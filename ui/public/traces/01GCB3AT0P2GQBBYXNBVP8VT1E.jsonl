To do so, we experimentally vary whether certificates on workers' non-cognitive skills are disclosed to both sides of the market during 1,200 real job interviews between young labor market entrants and small firms in Uganda. We elicit the beliefs of managers on the skills of workers after each job interview, and track the workers' labor market expectations and realized labor market outcomes for two years.\n\nOur results show that the certificates impact beliefs on both sides of the market: the certificates cause workers to increase their expectations, such as expected earnings, while managers of higher ability, who value non-cognitive skills more, revise their assessments of the workers' skills upwards. The updating of workers is driven by a reduction in their perceived difficulty of signaling skills in the market, rather than by workers learning about their own skills. The two-sided reaction to the certificates in terms of beliefs leads to a more efficient allocation of workers to jobs, which then causes earnings to increase, as employed workers with a certificate earn 11% more in the two years after the intervention. * We are grateful to Imran Rasul, Richard Blundell and Costas Meghir for their invaluable advice and support, and to everyone at BRAC Uganda who made this project possible. We also thank\n\nMatching the right workers to the right jobs is important for productivity. Models of job matching emphasize that the efficiency of the matching process depends on the information available to both workers and firms (Jovanovic, 1979;Chade, 2006;Chade and Eeckhout, 2017). On the one hand, difficulties in screening workers can affect the ability of firms to select the right employees. On the other hand, difficulties in signaling skills to employers can impact the ability of workers to match with the right jobs, or even their ex ante decision to acquire human capital (Spence, 1973). Understanding information frictions on skills is thus important, as they can affect the efficient allocation of labor, and ultimately productivity and output.\n\nThe information problem could be even more relevant in developing countries, where labor markets tend to be informal, and access to credible screening and signaling technologies is hindered. A key question for policy is thus to what extent these frictions contribute to explaining low productivity and low wages in developing countries, as well as what policy-makers can do to address them. However, the empirical evidence on how information frictions on skills affect labor markets in low income countries, and in particular on their consequences for both workers and firms through mismatch, is at best limited (McKenzie, 2017). 1 In this paper, we contribute to this literature by studying whether lack of information on the skills of workers at recruitment reduces productivity by distorting the efficient allocation of workers to jobs. To do so, we design a field experiment in the Ugandan labor market that has two key components: (i) a matching component, whereby firms and job seekers are matched together for real job interviews, and (ii) a signaling component, by introducing experimental variation in whether a credible signal on skills that are difficult to observe is shown to both sides of the market during the recruitment process, through the provision of certificates.\n\nOur main contribution is to study how both firms and workers respond to the credible signal on skills, and how this two-sided reaction affects the matching process. On the firm side, we identify whether managers revise their beliefs on the skills of workers. On the worker side, we study whether the certificates impact the workers' perceptions about what they can achieve in the labor market, such as their expected earnings. We then develop a job search model with uncertainty on the skills of workers to link the updating of workers and firms to labor market outcomes, and compare the model predictions to reduced form impacts of the signal on the allocation of labor, overall employment and worker earnings in the two years post intervention.\n\nOur sample includes young workers fresh out of vocational training and looking for jobs, as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) looking for workers. Young workers can be particularly affected by difficulties in signaling their skills, given their lack of work experience. Similarly, SMEs do not have access to sophisticated screening technologies, and so might be less able to screen workers, compared to larger firms.\n\nWe focus the information revelation on non-cognitive or \"soft\" skills, such as trustworthiness or reliability, which are hard to observe by nature, and have been shown to have high returns in the labor market both in high and low income countries. 2  In our context, we find that managers report difficulties in observing the soft skills of job applicants to be among their most important concerns. For example, stealing by their own employees is reported as one of the most important problems SMEs face. However, there is substantial variation in the importance given to soft skills: we show that managers with higher cognitive ability, who are also more profitable, value soft skills more in production.\n\nTo identify the specific soft skills to be revealed on the certificates, we use the stated preferences of firm owners over the skills they would find most useful to observe during recruitment. 3  e focus on five skills: attendance, communication skills, creativity, trustworthiness and willingness to help others. These are measured through assessments at the vocational institutes where the workers are enrolled, before graduation. We validate our measures of soft skills by showing that they predict earnings over the two-year study period in our Control group of workers, who do not receive a certificate.\n\nWe schedule and observe over 1,200 face-to-face real job interviews between our sample of SMEs and vocational training graduates. In a randomly selected half of these interviews, the soft skills certificates are revealed to both the worker and the firm, while in the other half, neither the worker nor the firm get to observe the certificate. We collect information on: (i) stated beliefs of firm owners on the skills of each applicant, (ii) job offers and hires as a result of the job interviews, (iii) outcomes of both workers and firms in the two years post intervention, regardless of whether the job interview turned into a hire, including information on workers' labor market expectations, preferences and job search behavior.\n\nWe document that our experimental sample of workers are positively selected on soft skills, relative to the eligible population of trainees at the vocational institutes. All eligible workers were informed that the results of their skills assessments could be disclosed to firm owners during the job interviews, and so this positive selection indicates that workers with higher skills understand they have more to benefit from participating.\n\nOur first set of results relate to whether firm owners and workers respond to the certificates by updating their beliefs. We find that managers of higher ability, who value soft skills more, revise upwards their beliefs on the skills of the matched workers. The positive effect is stronger for workers with higher skills, but we find no evidence of negative updating for workers with relatively lower skills. The positive selection of workers into the experiment, along with low expectations of managers about the workers' soft skills at baseline, can explain why the certificates create mostly positive news for high ability owners. On the contrary, low ability owners, who value soft skills less, do not react at all to the information in terms of their beliefs.\n\nWe show that workers also react to the certificates by revising upwards their labor market expectations: in the two years post intervention workers with a certificate report 7% higher expected earnings, 5% higher expected employment probability, a higher intention to bargain for wages and a larger ideal firm size. The certificates also lead workers to pull away from poorly paid casual work. We interpret these findings as evidence that the certificates raise the perceived outside option of workers, who try to transition to better jobs. We further show that the updating of workers is driven by a reduction in their perceived difficulty to signal skills in the market, rather than by workers learning about their skills or about the returns to skills.\n\nThe results on firm and worker updating are then linked together through a partial equilibrium search model with heterogeneous workers and firms. In the model, soft skills have higher returns when matched to higher ability managers, and so the efficient allocation exhibits positive sorting on soft skills/ability. However, difficulties in signaling and screening increase search frictions, which results in mismatch and loss of output. We model the intervention as an increase in the precision of the signal on skills, and we show how the provision of certificates affects (and improves) the allocation of labor. Workers with higher skills earn higher wages as certificates increase their outside option, by making them able to precisely signal their type to the firms where they are most productive. On the contrary, the model makes clear that workers with lower skills can be negatively affected by the certificates, as these reduce their employment probability at higher ability firms.\n\nThe reduced form evidence on employment and earnings confirms the model predictions. We find that the certificates cause an increase in sorting, by leading to an increase in the probability of employment between our experimental sample of workers, who are positively selected on soft skills, and higher ability managers. So it is precisely those managers who value soft skills more, and who react to the certificates by revising their beliefs, who also react in terms of their hiring choices. On the contrary, there is no change in probability of employment between our experimental workers and lower ability managers. While the certificates lead to a change in the allocation of labor, they do not result in an overall increase in probability of employment, neither at the initially matched firms, nor in other firms that workers match to later on. However, in line with the allocation of labor being more efficient, experimental workers with a certificate earn 11% more while employed in the two years post intervention.\n\nThe estimated earnings benefits from the certificates outweigh the program costs. In line with the average experimental worker benefitting from the certificates, we show that workers in the Control group would be willing to pay over 40% of their monthly earnings to obtain one. Interestingly, their willingness to pay is very close to the cost of the certificates, and so we discuss potential reasons why similar certificates are not already provided by the market. Finally, we discuss the implications of introducing a mandatory certification policy on soft skills. This is an interesting exercise because we showed that those workers who decided not to participate in the intervention are negatively selected on soft skills, and so, as highlighted by the model, could be negatively affected by the certificates. In particular, we show how the cost-effectiveness of the intervention for the average eligible worker deteriorates as a function of the (negative) conjectured impact on earnings for those workers who selected out. We find that if the negative impact on the non-participants is larger than a 20% decrease in earnings, the intervention is no longer cost-effective for the average worker. This highlights how mandatory certification policies, while raising efficiency through the improved allocation of labor, could also have important redistributive effects among workers.\n\nOur study extends a very recent but growing literature on how labor market frictions in developing countries affect workers and firms (Abel et al., 2016; Abebe et al., 2017a,b; Groh et al.,\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"Non-cognitive skills certificate disclosure to job candidates and firms\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "multiline": true, "verbose": false, "default": "", "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def answer(\n        self,\n        *,\n        context: str,\n        question: str,\n        multiline: bool = False,\n        verbose: bool = False,\n        default: str = \"\",\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate an answer to a question given some context.\"\"\"\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(question)\n        stop = None if multiline else \"\\n\"\n        response = await self._complete(\n            context + question, stop=stop, max_tokens=max_tokens\n        )\n        answer = self._extract_answer(response)\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(answer)\n        return answer\n"}, "01GCB3B0MEQQ14G3SRB4K7RDAA.children.01GCB3B0MQDFSG9C7GJT9VTW0W": true}

Short-term reversible adverse effects associated with use in adults and children are well documented and include anemia, neutropenia, and elevation of liver enzyme levels. 3,4 In preclinical lifetime animal carcinogenicity studies, high dosages of zidovudine administered to adult rodents have been associated with the development of vaginal epithelial neoplasms in female rodents receiving the highest dosage, a finding that may be explained by the presence of high concentrations of unmetabolized zidovudine in the rodent urine and reflux from the bladder into the vagina. 5 lthough no significant short-term toxic effects were observed in PACTG 076 for those mothers and infants who received zidovudine, the late effects of in utero zidovudine exposure for growing children and adults are unknown. Based on theoretical concerns about the unknown long-term consequences in utero, PACTG 076 infant participants were prospectively monitored for late effects of therapy in an ongoing longterm follow-up study, the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 219 (PACTG 219).\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to describe the safety of perinatal zidovudine for prevention of mother-tochild HIV transmission among HIVuninfected children with in utero zidovudine exposure. Prospective comparative evaluations were made of the growth, immunologic, cognitive/developmental, cardiac, ophthalmologic, neoplasm, and mortality data available to date for the uninfected children from PACTG 076 coenrolled in PACTG 219 who were randomized to zidovudine or placebo prenatally, intrapartum, and during the immediate postnatal period.\n\nThe Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zidovudine for prevention of peri-natal HIV-1 transmission conducted in the United States and France. Asymptomatic pregnant women who were infected with HIV and their newborns were randomized to receive either zidovudine or placebo. Women were treated with oral zidovudine prepartum and intravenous zidovudine during the intrapartum period. Infants received the same randomized treatment assignment as their mothers for the first 6 weeks of life. The first subject enrolled in April 1991. The study was closed to new enrollment and unblinded in February 1994, after an interim analysis demonstrated a significant effect of zidovudine in reducing the risk of perinatal HIV transmission. 1 ll caregivers of infants enrolled in PACTG 076 centers in the United States were offered long-term follow-up for their children in PACTG 219, a long-term, prospective, observational study designed to assess late effects of in utero and neonatal exposure to antiretroviral drugs in perinatal HIV clinical trials as well as late effects of antiretroviral treatment in infected children. All children participating in PACTG perinatal prevention or treatment trials are eligible for enrollment. Comprehensive history taking and physical examinations, including growth, cognitive/developmental function, and quality-of-life data, are performed at least annually. Children are scheduled to be followed up until age 21 years. Since 1993, more than 2200 children initially enrolled in PACTG trials have been followed up in PACTG 219, and one quarter of these children had participated in perinatal prevention trials. The study was approved by the review boards for human subject research at each participating institution. Written informed consent was obtained from each child's parent or legal guardian.\n\nThe study population chosen for these analyses included children who participated in PACTG 076 and subsequently enrolled in PACTG 219. Data available as of February 28, 1997, from PACTG 076 children who were born on or before January 4, 1994, were included in this analysis. Children born after January 4, 1994, were excluded because they could not have completed 6 weeks of blinded treatment before the PACTG 076 study was unblinded. All analyses are based on the randomized assignment in PACTG 076 and are intent-to-treat analyses. Findings from uninfected children randomized to zidovudine in utero and for 6 weeks postpartum were compared with uninfected children randomized to placebo.\n\nHistory, physical examination, growth measurements, and quality-of-life assessments were collected at baseline and every 6 months for children younger than 2 years and every 12 months after age 2 years. Lymphocyte subsets were collected on the same schedule until age 2 years but only as clinically indicated thereafter. Percentages of lymphocyte subsets vary less with age and were used for these analyses. 6,7 Growth and lymphocyte subset data from PACTG 219 were combined with data collected during the initial 18-month follow-up period of the PACTG 076 protocol.\n\nCognitive/developmental function tests consisted of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 8 for children 30 months of age or younger and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Ability 9 for children aged 30 months to 6 years. Tests were performed at baseline and every 6 months through 24 months of age and then at age 3 years. Raw data from the tests were individually reviewed by the protocol psychologist (K.O.) to ensure that tests seen as invalid by the site examiner and the protocol psychologist were not included in the analyses and questionable data (eg, widely variable scores from one test to the next) could be verified by a query to the site.\n\nEchocardiograms and ophthalmologic examinations (including visual acuity assessment and funduscopic examination) were required for all children by 36 months of age. Sites were asked to enter all echocardiographic and funduscopic results into the database regardless of whether the examination was performed as part of PACTG 219. Examining cardiologists and ophthalmologists were asked to report the clinical rel-evance of any abnormal echocardiogram or funduscopic findings, other related clinical findings (if any), and the child's current diagnosis, management plan, and health status.\n\nAll data, including deaths, echocardiogram results, funduscopic examination results, and cognitive/developmental function test results, were reviewed by members of the study team who were blinded to PACTG 076 treatment assignment.\n\nComparisons were based on PACTG 076 randomized treatment assignments and performed using t tests or Wilcoxon tests for continuous outcomes, the likelihood ratio x 2 test or Fisher exact test for categorical outcomes, and the Wei-Johnson method on repeated measures over time. 10 All P values are 2-sided.\n\nInfant length/height, weight, and head circumference measurements were converted to age-and sex-adjusted z scores using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/World Health Organization international growth standard based on the National Center for Health Statistics and Fels reference databases. 11,12 roup mean scores were calculated for specified nominal ages and expressed as the corresponding percentile.\n\nThe statistical power of this follow-up study for each outcome measure is indicated below the width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference from the placebo group mean, based on the sample sizes available. These CIs were calculated assuming a constant difference over time, based on the Wei-Johnson test. 10 Confidence intervals were also translated into more meaningful metrics, eg, the CI for the difference in z scores of weight for age was translated into a difference in SD units (SDU, expressed as a proportion of the SD of the outcome variable) as well as a difference in weight in kilograms.\n\nThe 95% CI for a difference between treatment groups over 36 months in weight-for-age z scores was \u00b10.25 z scores or \u00b10.18 SDU (corresponding to a difference of \u00b10.50 kg from the placebo group mean). The 95% CI for a dif-ference in height-for-age z scores over 36 months was \u00b10.24 z scores or \u00b10.22 SDU (corresponding to a difference of \u00b11.0 cm from the placebo group mean). The 95% CI for a difference in head circumferencefor-age z scores over 24 months was \u00b10.25 z scores, or \u00b10.21 SDU. Similarly, the 95% CI for a difference in CD4 + T lymphocyte percentage over 24 months was \u00b11.8% (0.25 SDU), and for CD8 + T lymphocyte percentage was \u00b11.5% (0.27 SDU). The 95% CI for a difference in Bayley scores over 24 months was \u00b15.0 points (0.28 SDU). With only 1 follow-up at 36 months, the 95% CI for a difference in McCarthy scores was \u00b18.9 points (0.54 SDU).\n\nThree hundred thirty-two PACTG 076 uninfected infants (177 in the zidovudine group and 155 in the placebo group) were born at US centers on or before January 4, 1994, and were alive at the time PACTG 219 opened to enrollment in May 1993. Two hundred thirty-four (122 in the zidovudine group and 112 in the placebo group) enrolled in PACTG 219 and met the defined criteria for inclusion in these analyses. One PACTG 076 infant who enrolled at 12 months of age into PACTG 219 was lost to follow-up before infection status was determined. This infant has been excluded from the analyses.\n\nTwo hundred thirty-four uninfected children randomized to zidovudine or placebo were born to 230 mothers (1.7% twin births). Characteristics of these mothers and uninfected children were similar to those of the original PACTG 076 study population and did not differ significantly when compared with the mothers and uninfected children who did not enroll in PACTG 219 (TABLE 1 ). As of February 28, 1997, the median age of the children at the time of the last follow-up visit was 4.2 years (range, 3.2-5.6 years) and 86% of the uninfected children enrolled in PACTG 219 were still participating in the study; 26 children were lost to follow-up or their caregivers refused further contact.\n\nDeaths and Malignancies. There were no deaths or malignancies among the uninfected children.\n\nGrowth. Mean age percentiles for weight and height are shown in FIGURE 1 . The uninfected zidovudine group and placebo group followed similar curves, with normal mean weight and height. There were no observed differences between the groups through 208 weeks.\n\nLikewise, no treatment differences in head circumference were noted (Figure 1 ).\n\nCognitive/Developmental Function. Five hundred ten Bayley and Mc-Carthy assessments were available from 209 uninfected children (108 in the zidovudine group and 101 in the placebo group). A total of 466 evaluable tests (91%) were included in the analysis.\n\nOverall, both the zidovudine and placebo uninfected children demonstrated normal cognitive/developmental function. Immunologic Function. Among the uninfected PACTG 076/219 children, mean CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocyte percentages did not differ between treatment groups over time (FIGURE 2 ).

Children 1 to 59 months of age were identified in twice-yearly censuses and were offered participation in the trial. Vital status was determined at subsequent censuses. The primary outcome was aggregate all-cause mortality; country-specific rates were assessed in prespecified subgroup analyses.\n\nA total of 1533 communities underwent randomization, 190,238 children were identified in the census at baseline, and 323,302 person-years were monitored. The mean (\u00b1SD) azithromycin and placebo coverage over the four twice-yearly distributions was 90.4\u00b110.4%. The overall annual mortality rate was 14.6 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received azithromycin (9.1 in Malawi, 22.5 in Niger, and 5.4 in Tanzania) and 16.5 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received placebo (9.6 in Malawi, 27.5 in Niger, and 5.5 in Tanzania). Mortality was 13.5% lower overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 19.8) in communities that received azithromycin than in communities that received placebo (P<0.001); the rate was 5.7% lower in Malawi (95% CI, \u22129.7 to 18.9), 18.1% lower in Niger (95% CI, 10.0 to 25.5), and 3.4% lower in Tanzania (95% CI, \u221221.2 to 23.0). Children in the age group of 1 to 5 months had the greatest effect from azithromycin (24.9% lower mortality than that with placebo; 95% CI, 10.6 to 37.0). Serious adverse events occurring within a week after administration of the trial drug or placebo were uncommon, and the rate did not differ significantly between the groups. Evaluation of selection for antibiotic resistance is ongoing.\n\nAmong postneonatal, preschool children in sub-Saharan Africa, childhood mortality was lower in communities randomly assigned to mass distribution of azithromycin than in those assigned to placebo, with the largest effect seen in Niger. Any implementation of a policy of mass distribution would need to strongly consider the potential effect of such a strategy on antibiotic resistance. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; MORDOR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02047981.\n\nT rachoma-control programs have distributed more than 600 million doses of oral azithromycin in an effort to eliminate the ocular strains of chlamydia that cause the disease. 1,2 ][11][12][13][14] The results of a case-control study and a clusterrandomized trial in an area of Ethiopia in which trachoma is endemic suggested that mass distribution of azithromycin might reduce childhood mortality. 15,16 Some experts believed that a mortality benefit was, indeed, possible, although it would probably be smaller in magnitude than what was found in these studies. 17 e tested the hypothesis that twice-yearly mass distributions of oral azithromycin would reduce mortality in children 1 to 59 months of age. The trial was performed in three geographically distinct areas: Malawi in southern Africa, Niger in West Africa, and Tanzania in East Africa. Azithromycin affects transmissible diseases, so the treatment of one person might have an effect on others in the same community. Thus, randomization and intervention were conducted at the community level, and inferences of efficacy were made at the community level. Since death is a relatively rare event even in these settings, a large trial population was required. Therefore, we adopted a trial strategy with a straightforward intervention and primary outcome. 18\n\nEligibility MORDOR (Macrolides Oraux pour R\u00e9duire les D\u00e9c\u00e8s avec un Oeil sur la R\u00e9sistance) was a cluster-randomized trial conducted in the Malawian district of Mangochi, in the Nigerien districts of Boboye and Loga, and in the Tanzanian districts of Kilosa and Gairo, with communities as the unit of randomization. The community that served as the randomization unit was a health surveillance assistance area in Malawi, a grappe (i.e., a cluster of households representing the smallest government health unit) in Niger, and a hamlet in Tanzania. None of the districts were eligible for mass distributions of azithromycin for trachoma on the basis of the most recent mapping, and none of the children who participated in the trial had previously received azithromycin. Enrollment was based on census information available before the trial. Communities with a population between 200 and 2000 inhabitants on the most recent census were eligible for enrollment (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Communities remained in the trial even if the population drifted out of this range. All children 1 to 59 months of age (truncated to month) who weighed at least 3800 g were eligible to receive azithromycin or placebo.\n\nLists of communities from the most recent pretrial census were submitted to the data coordinating center at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). For each country, communities were randomly assigned in equal proportions to 1 of 10 letters, with 5 letters coded for azithromycin and 5 for placebo (more information is provided in the statistical analysis plan in the protocol, available at NEJM.org). Randomization was performed with the sample function in R software, version 3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Only key trial personnel were aware of which letters corresponded to each group. Participants, observers, investigators, and datacleaning team members were unaware of the group assignments. Centralized randomization and simultaneous assignment of communities facilitated complete concealment of the assignments. The placebo contained the vehicle of the oral azithromycin suspension and was bottled and labeled identically to azithromycin. Both placebo and azithromycin were donated by Pfizer, which reviewed the protocol but had no other role in the trial.\n\nA house-to-house census was performed during five prescribed 6-month periods, with allowance for a 2-month grace period for the initial census. At the initial census, all households in the community were recorded in a custom-built mobile application (Conexus); the name of the head of household and the global positioning system coordinates were used to facilitate location of the household for the following census. All children 1 to 59 months of age in the household were identified. Pregnant women and children younger than 1 month of age were also documented in anticipation of the next census. At follow-up censuses, the vital status (alive, dead, or unknown) and residence (living in community, moved outside community, or unknown) were recorded for the children who had been present in the previous census records. Pregnant women and children younger than 1 month of age were documented, and children 1 to 59 months of age who had moved into the community after the previous census were also documented and were offered participation. Census data were collected in communities in the same general order throughout the trial. Data were uploaded to the Salesforce cloud database service (Salesforce). Data cleaning was performed with the use of the Salesforce platform; Stata software, version 13.1 (Statacorp); and R software.\n\nEach child 1 to 59 months of age at the time of the census was offered a single directly observed dose of oral azithromycin or placebo (according to the randomization of their community). Children were given a volume of suspension corresponding to at least 20 mg per kilogram of body weight, calculated with the use of a height stick (see the protocol), in accordance with the country's trachoma program guidelines, or by weight for children unable to stand. Children who were known to be allergic to macrolides were not given azithromycin or placebo. Azithromycin or placebo was administered at the time of the census or during additional visits in an attempt to achieve at least 80% coverage. Administration of trial medication or placebo was documented in the mobile application for each child, and community coverage was calculated relative to the census. The parents or guardians of the children and the local health posts were instructed to contact a village representative regarding any adverse events noted within 7 days after administration of azithromycin or placebo; the village representative reported the events to the site coordinator, who in turn reported the events to UCSF.\n\nThe prespecified primary outcome was the community-level, aggregate, three-country mortality rate determined with the use of data from twice-yearly censuses. Each intercensal period was analyzed separately, with a death counted only when a child was recorded as having been alive and living in the household at the time of one census and recorded as having died while residing in the community by the time of the next census. By design, no attempt was made to track down a child's status after the child moved out of the community. Person-time at risk was measured as the days between consecutive censuses; children who moved, died, or had an unknown follow-up status contributed to one half of the intercensal period. All children documented as being alive and residing in the household at the time of the initial census of each intercensal period were included in the analysis. No changes to trial outcomes were made after the trial had begun.\n\nMortality rates were assessed according to country site and age group. An abbreviated version of the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) verbal autopsy questionnaire for children 4 weeks to 14 years of age was used to collect data for verbal autopsies. 19 Causes of death were assigned according to an algorithm based on a published verbal autopsy hierarchy. 20\n\nApproval for the trial was obtained from the ethics committees at the College of Medicine, University of Malawi, Blantyre; the Niger Ministry of Health; the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; the UCSF Committee on Human Research; Emory University; and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Oral informed consent was obtained in Malawi and Niger, and written informed consent was obtained in Tanzania. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. No incentives were offered for participation. All children in the communities in Niger were offered treatment with azithromycin at the conclusion of the trial. By design, communities in Malawi were entered into the country's trachoma-control program, even though prior district-level data had not met the criteria for mass distribution.\n\nA data and safety monitoring committee provided oversight. The members of the steering committee (see the Supplementary Appendix), who were also investigators in the trial, designed the trial and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Full details of the trial design and analyses are provided in the protocol and the statistical analysis plan. The last author wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. All the authors contributed to subsequent revisions and agreed to submit the manuscript for publication.\n\nWe estimated that the inclusion of 620 communities per country would provide at least 80% power to detect 10% lower all-cause mortality overall with azithromycin than with placebo. Specifically, we assumed that mortality rates would be between 14 and 20 deaths per 1000 person-years in the placebo group, that the average community sizes would be 600 to 799 people (of whom 16.7 to 19.0% would be children 1 to 59 months of age), that coefficients of variation would be between 0.40 and 0.51, and that the loss to follow-up would be 10%.\n\nThe prespecified primary analysis was negative binomial regression of the number of deaths per community, with treatment group and country as predictors and total person-time at risk as an offset.\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"Oral azithromycin for childhood mortality\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "multiline": true, "verbose": false, "default": "", "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def answer(\n        self,\n        *,\n        context: str,\n        question: str,\n        multiline: bool = False,\n        verbose: bool = False,\n        default: str = \"\",\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate an answer to a question given some context.\"\"\"\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(question)\n        stop = None if multiline else \"\\n\"\n        response = await self._complete(\n            context + question, stop=stop, max_tokens=max_tokens\n        )\n        answer = self._extract_answer(response)\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(answer)\n        return answer\n"}, "01GCB3B0MJGMXAR2091ZDP7C22.children.01GCB3B0NCT9JS5VH1Z623KSDE": true}

We assessed the effect of weekly iron (120 mg elemental iron) and vitamin A (25 000 IU) supplementation on hemoglobin, iron status and malaria and nonmalaria morbidity in adolescent schoolgirls. Subjects/Methods: A total of 279 schoolgirls aged 12-18 years from public primary schools in Kisumu, western Kenya. Doubleblind randomized placebo-controlled trial using a factorial design. Results: Five months of iron supplementation was associated with a 0.52 g dl \u00c01 (0.21, 0.82) greater increase in hemoglobin relative to iron placebo. The effect was only observed in girls with iron deficiency on enrollment (1.34 g dl \u00c01 (0.79, 1.88)), but not in iron-replete girls (\u00c00.20 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.59, 0.18)). Similar differences in treatment effect were seen between menstruating and nonmenstruating girls. The effect of iron was independent of vitamin A. The baseline prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was low (6.7%) and no sustained increase in hemoglobin was seen with weekly vitamin A (\u00c00.07 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.38, 0.25)). Incidence of malaria parasitemia was higher in the iron than iron-placebo groups (Rate ratio 1.33 (0.94, 1.88)). Conclusions: Weekly iron supplementation results in substantial increases in hemoglobin concentration in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya, which may outweigh possible risks caused by malaria, but only in iron-deficient or menstruating girls and not in iron-replete and nonmenstruating girls.\n\nAnemia, including iron deficiency anemia, remains one of the most widespread public health problems in developing countries, with preschool children and pregnant women most severely affected (WHO, 2001) . During adolescence, requirements of iron and other micronutrients, including vitamin A, increase due to the rapid expansion of total blood volume and increase in lean body mass during the growth spurt, and following the onset of menstruation (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). In settings where additional risk factors of anemia (for example, malaria and hookworm) prevail and nutritional intake is inadequate, adolescents are at significant risk of developing anemia, with or without iron deficiency. The prevalence of anemia in adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be around 40% (DeMaeyer and Adiels-Tegman, 1985;ACC/SCN, 1997).\n\nAdverse consequences of anemia and iron deficiency range from severe morbidity to more subtle effects on physical work capacity and deficits in cognitive development and potentially school performance (Stoltzfus, 2001). Prepregnancy hemoglobin level and iron status are also important determinants of the risk of anemia-related morbidity and mortality during pregnancy (Brabin et al., 1998;Bothwell, 2000). Furthermore, iron deficiency may be associated with retarded growth, which in turn may be associated with obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion (Harrison, 1985).\n\nVitamin A requirements also rise significantly during puberty reflecting the role of this nutrient in sexual maturation (Michaelsson et al., 1976). Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), even when subclinical, may cause anemia through the modulation of iron metabolism as reviewed by Semba and Bloem (2002). Randomized trials in anemic subjects have shown that vitamin A added to iron supplementation gave better hematological response than iron alone (Hodges et al., 1978;Mejia and Chew, 1988;Suharno et al., 1993). VAD is also recognized to play a role in growth, development and the functioning of the immune system (ACC/ SCN, 1997).\n\nThere is a long-standing controversy about the safety of iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Although iron deficiency causes a number of biochemical abnormalities and impaired cell-mediated immunity with increased susceptibility to infections (Fleming, 1987), concerns have also been raised that hyperferremia resulting from iron therapy may exacerbate infections, in particular malaria (Oppenheimer, 2001). The controversy has received renewed attention following the recent findings from a study in Zanzibar that reported in an increased rate of severe diseases and death in malaria-endemic Zanzibar (Sazawal et al., 2006). Because vitamin A supplementation raises serum iron this might also increase susceptibility to infection. On the other hand vitamin A supplementation in deficient individuals may boost the immune response and has been shown to provide protection against a number of infections (Villamor and Fawzi, 2000). High-dose vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce the number and severity of clinical malaria attacks in one trial (Shankar et al., 1999) but not in another (Binka et al., 1995).\n\nSchool-based interventions in adolescent girls offer an opportunity to combat iron deficiency, anemia and stunting before pregnancy (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of weekly supplementation with iron alone, vitamin A alone or a combination of the two, on hemoglobin concentration and iron status in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya. We also determined whether the addition of vitamin A has the potential to decrease or neutralize any adverse effects of iron supplementation on morbidity both from malaria and other infections.\n\nThis study was conducted between April 1998 and November 1998 in the city of Kisumu (population B320 000), located on the shores of Lake Victoria, in Nyanza Province, western Kenya.\n\nMalaria transmission in this urban area is largely uncharacterized, but is perennial with highest transmission during peak rainfall from April -July and October -December. Exposure to infective mosquitoes is likely to vary from the city center to the peri-urban areas (Robert et al., 2003). A study of pregnant women attending the hospital antenatal clinic reported an overall parasitemia prevalence in teenage pregnancies of 25% (van Eijk et al., 2001) . Approximately 26% of 15-to 19-year-old girls are estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (Glynn et al., 2001). A study of vitamin A status conducted in a rural area 60 km north west of Kisumu found the prevalence of VAD (serum retinol p0.70 mmol l \u00c01 ) to be 55.2 and 17.5% in preschool and primary school girls, respectively, and none with signs of xerophthalmia (Friis et al., 1997). A study in pregnant women receiving folate supplementation suggested that folate deficiency is not a major cause of anemia among pregnant women in this area (Ouma et al., 2006).\n\nThis was a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 2 \u00c2 2 factorial design. After consent was obtained from the parents-teachers associations of 14 public primary schools within the Kisumu municipality, all girls 12-18 years were screened for the presence of anemia using a portable Hemocue system (HaemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). For logistical reasons, only schools with 410 girls fulfiling the entry criteria were considered. Girls with mild-to-moderate anemia were enrolled 6-8 weeks after screening, when a questionnaire and physical examination were completed and a repeat finger-prick blood sample taken. Pregnancy tests were conducted for girls with a history of delayed menstruation. Any girls with severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) o 7.0 g dl \u00c01 ), evidence of severe VAD (that is, signs of xerophthalmia), pregnancy or concomitant disease requiring hospitalization were excluded.\n\nBalanced block randomization scheme (N \u00bc 12) was used. Active and placebo supplements were manufactured by Laboratory and Allied Limited (Nairobi, Kenya). The key was revealed only after completion of the study.\n\nStudy participants were given one of the following supplementations: (1) iron and vitamin A, (2) iron and vitamin A placebo, (3) vitamin A and iron placebo or (4) iron placebo and vitamin A placebo (double placebo). Iron supplementation consisted of 120 mg elemental iron in the form of two 200 mg ferrous-sulfate tablets given once weekly. Vitamin A was given as 25 000 IU (8.3 mg) retinol in the form of a gelatin capsule once weekly, a dose considered safe in first trimester pregnancy (WHO, 1998) . Tablets and capsule were given at the same time with a glass of water.\n\nAll schools were visited weekly by a study nurse for supervised administration of study supplements. If girls were absent, supplements were left with the teachers. Supervised treatment was not possible during a 3-week leave period between two school terms and a 2-week teachers' strike. Instructions were given to the girls to take the study supplements at home.\n\nThe study was initially designed to include a 6-month intervention period, but shortened to 5 months following an early request from the teachers because the sixth month would have fallen in the school examination month. Girls were seen monthly after enrollment for a finger-prick blood sample (for hemoglobin concentration and malaria smear), questionnaire (including medical history, menstrual history, history of potential side effects and use of medication in the prior month) and basic physical examination (including clinical impression, skin rash and axillary temperature).\n\nAt weekly treatment visits, girls were seen by the study nurse. Girls with symptomatic illness were referred to a dedicated study pediatrician. Each girl was given a health passport and girls suspecting illness could report directly to this clinic at no cost. The study pediatrician filled in a dedicated study form that was used for passive surveillance.\n\nA Coulter Counter (Model M530, Coulter Electronics Limited, Luton, UK) was used to determine hemoglobin concentration. Daily control samples were run to determine the daily coefficient of variation, which never exceeded 7%. Blood cells and plasma were separated and stored at \u00c020 1C, and subsequently at \u00c080 1C until further processing.\n\nFerritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on stored samples in a multiplexed bead-based assay as previously described (Coutinho et al., 2005). Retinol-binding protein (RBP) was measured on stored samples in a competitive binding assay using RBP (RDI, Concord, MA, USA) coupled to microspheres as target and biotinylated anti-RBP (courtesy of Dr Hix, PATH, Seattle, WA, USA) as the competitive detection Ab, essentially as described (Coutinho et al., 2005). RBP is known to occur as a 1:1 molar complex with retinol and can be used as a surrogate marker of serum retinol and equimolar cutoffs for RBP with similar sensitivity and specificity to predict VAD as serum retinol (Gamble et al., 2001). All laboratory markers for iron and vitamin A status could be assessed only for the baseline and 3 months time points, because more than 80% of stored samples taken at the 5-month time point were lost in transport.\n\nThick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and examined for the presence of malaria parasites with a \u00c2 100 oil-emersion objective as previously described (Leenstra et al., 2003a).\n\nMeasurements of height and weight were performed at baseline according to standard World Health Organization procedures as described (Leenstra et al., 2005). Sexual maturation was assessed using a modified Tanner score based on the assessment of breast development only (Tanner, 1962).\n\nWe estimated that a sample size of 220 participants (55 per arm) would be sufficient to detect a 0.5 g dl \u00c01 . difference in the mean change in hemoglobin between the treatment groups by the end of the intervention period, with 90% power and 95% confidence, anticipating 20% dropout and assuming a standard deviation of the mean Hb level of 0.8 g dl \u00c01 .\n\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS (version 8.02, Statistical Application Software Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Analyses were done on an intention to treat basis. Ferritin, RBP, malaria and parasitemia were log normally distributed, and the data were Log e transformed (Ln(value \u00fe 1)).\n\nChanges in mean Hb, ferritin and RBP were assessed using a repeated measures linear regression model to adjust for within-subject correlation of the endpoint over time (F\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"iron supplementation\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "multiline": true, "verbose": false, "default": "", "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def answer(\n        self,\n        *,\n        context: str,\n        question: str,\n        multiline: bool = False,\n        verbose: bool = False,\n        default: str = \"\",\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate an answer to a question given some context.\"\"\"\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(question)\n        stop = None if multiline else \"\\n\"\n        response = await self._complete(\n            context + question, stop=stop, max_tokens=max_tokens\n        )\n        answer = self._extract_answer(response)\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(answer)\n        return answer\n"}, "01GCB3B0MNPKKHES3ARVT012K4.children.01GCB3B0NGBPNS23RTF2DZE5WV": true}

However, there is uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of blood-pressurelowering treatments for many such patients. The perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) was designed to determine the effects of a blood-pressurelowering regimen in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.\n\nMethods 6105 individuals from 172 centres in Asia, Australasia, and Europe were randomly assigned active treatment (n=3051) or placebo (n=3054). Active treatment comprised a flexible regimen based on the angiotensinconverting-enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of treating physicians. The primary outcome was total stroke (fatal or non-fatal). Analysis was by intention to treat.\n\nFindings Over 4 years of follow up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg. 307 (10%) individuals assigned active treatment suffered a stroke, compared with 420 (14%) assigned placebo (relative risk reduction 28% [95% CI , p<0\u20220001). Active treatment also reduced the risk of total major vascular events (26% [16][17][18][19][20][21][22] [23] [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]). There were similar reductions in the risk of stroke in hypertensive and non-hypertensive subgroups (all p<0\u202201). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide reduced blood pressure by 12/5 mm Hg and stroke risk by 43% . Single-drug therapy reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg and produced no discernable reduction in the risk of stroke.\n\nInterpretation This blood-pressure-lowering regimen reduced the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide produced larger blood pressure reductions and larger risk reductions than did single drug therapy with perindopril alone. Treatment with these two agents should now be considered routinely for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, irrespective of their blood pressure.\n\nStrokes kill about 5 million people each year, making cerebrovascular disease the second leading cause of death worldwide. 1 At least 15 million others have non-fatal strokes annually, and about a third are disabled as a consequence. 2,3 Among those who survive a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack, the risk of further stroke is very high: at least one in six suffer another stroke within 5 years. 3 The identification of safe and effective treatments for the prevention of recurrent stroke is therefore a priority. Antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of stroke and other major vascular events by between a sixth and a fifth among individuals with a history of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 4,5 and is now prescribed routinely to these patients. Carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of recurrent ipsilateral stroke in those with carotid stenosis, 6,7 and anticoagulant therapy reduces recurrent stroke risk in those with atrial fibrillation, 8 but each of these two treatments is suitable for only a small proportion of all patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. No treatment has been proven to reduce recurrent stroke risk among patients with a history of cerebral haemorrhage.\n\nObservational studies have shown that usual blood pressure levels are directly and continuously associated with the initial occurrence of ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage. 9 As a consequence, blood pressure is recognised as an important determinant of the risk of initial stroke in non-hypertensive individuals as well as in those with hypertension. 9,10 Fewer data are available about the associations of blood pressure with recurrent stroke. Hypertension has been associated with an increased risk of stroke recurrence in some, 11,12 but not other, 13 community studies of outcome after first stroke. In two small clinical studies, 14,15 blood pressure seemed to be directly associated with the risk of stroke recurrence among patients with a history of recent cerebral haemorrhage. In one of these studies, 14 a J-shaped relation between blood pressure and recurrent stroke was seen among patients with a recent history of ischaemic stroke. However, such non-linearity might reflect \"reverse causality\", whereby the most severe cerebrovascular disease lowers blood pressure and independently worsens prognosis. 16 A much larger study 17 of 2435 clinically stable individuals with a history of minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack detected no evidence of nonlinearity in the association of usual blood pressure with stroke recurrence: each 10 mm Hg lower level of systolic pressure was associated with a 28% (SE 8) lower risk of stroke.\n\nSystematic reviews of randomised trials of bloodpressure-lowering drugs in hypertensive patients, mostly without cerebrovascular disease, have shown that sustained blood pressure reductions of about Randomised trial of a perindopril-based blood-pressure-lowering regimen among 6105 individuals with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack PROGRESS Collaborative Group* Articles 5-6 mm Hg diastolic reduced the risk of initial stroke by about a third, 18 with no large differences apparent between the main drug classes. 19 Those studies provided little evidence about the separate effects of treatment on ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage. There are comparatively few randomised trials of blood-pressurelowering drugs among patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease: a meta-analysis 20 of the four trials with published final results (involving 2742 patients, most of whom had a history of ischaemic stroke) suggested that blood pressure reductions of about 6-8 mm Hg systolic and 3-4 mm Hg diastolic were associated with a fifth fewer recurrent strokes. However, the confidence interval for this estimate of treatment effect was wide and consistent with no worthwhile effect as well as with benefit. Analyses of subsets of patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease included in other trials of antihypertensive treatment regimens 21 or of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 22 yielded similar results. Clearer evidence of benefits of blood-pressure-lowering treatments for recurrent stroke risk was provided by a preliminary report from a trial of the diuretic indapamide among 5665 individuals with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack. 23  However, final results from that study remain unpublished.\n\nThe perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) 24 was started by an independent collaborative research group in an effort to resolve clinical uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of routine bloodpressure-lowering therapy for individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. We report here the principal results from this randomised, placebo-controlled trial.\n\nThe aim of PROGRESS was to determine the effects of a flexible blood-pressure-lowering regimen, involving an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and a diuretic (indapamide), on the risk of stroke and other major vascular events among individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The study was conducted in 172 collaborating centres from ten countries (see end of paper). The institutional ethics committee of each collaborating centre approved the trial and all participants provided written informed consent. The study methods and objectives are published in detail elsewhere 24 and are described here in brief.\n\nPatients were potentially eligible if they had a history of stroke (evidence of an acute disturbance of focal neurological function with symptoms lasting more than 24 h and thought to be due to intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemia) or transient ischaemic attack (evidence of an acute disturbance of focal neurological or monocular function with symptoms lasting less than 24 h and thought to be due to arterioembolic or thrombotic vascular disease) within the previous 5 years. Participants were required to have, in the opinion of the responsible physician, no definite indication (such as heart failure) for treatment with an ACE inhibitor and no definite contraindication (such as previous intolerance) to such treatment. There were no blood pressure entry criteria, although it was recommended that individuals with uncontrolled hypertension receive antihypertensive therapy with agents other than ACE inhibitors before entry to the trial. It was also recommended that participants should be clinically stable for at least 2 weeks after their most recent vascular event before entry to the study.\n\nPotentially eligible individuals entered a 4-week prerandomisation run-in period during which they received open-label perindopril (2 mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 4 mg daily for another 2 weeks). Participants who adhered to, and tolerated, the run-in treatment were randomly assigned, on a double-blind basis, continued active therapy or matching placebo. Active treatment comprised a flexible regimen based on perindopril (4 mg daily) with the addition of indapamide (2\u20225 mg daily, except in Japan where the dose was 2\u20220 mg daily) in patients for whom the responsible physician judged there to be no specific indication for or contraindication to treatment with a diuretic. Patients assigned placebo received placebo tablets identical in appearance to perindopril, and those for whom the attending physician judged there to be no specific indication for or contraindication to treatment with a diuretic also received placebo tablets identical in appearance to indapamide. The rationale for allowing the use of combination therapy was to maximise the size of the blood pressure reduction achieved.\n\nFlexibility with regard to the use of combination or single-drug therapy (or matching placebos) for individual patients was an important clinical consideration, given the initial uncertainty of many collaborating doctors about the safety of intensive blood-pressure lowering for patients with cerebrovascular disease, particularly those with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and average, or below average, blood pressure at entry. Similar considerations have guided the use of study treatment regimens in many other blood-pressurelowering trials, 18,19 in which the treating physicians were given some discretion as to the intensity of treatment provided to individual patients. However, in the present study, unlike most previous trials, the responsible physician was asked before randomisation about his or her intentions with respect to treatment intensity. Thus, the randomised treatment allocation in PROGRESS could be stratified by the intention to use a single study tablet (perindopril or single placebo) or combination study tablets (perindopril plus indapamide, or double placebo), as well as by study centre, age, sex, entry systolic blood pressure, and qualifying event. Study treatment allocation was provided by a central computerbased randomisation service accessed by telephone or facsimile. Participants were instructed to take study tablets daily. All other aspects of medical and surgical care were left to the discretion of the responsible physician.\n\nIn the year after randomisation, participants were seen on five occasions. In the second and subsequent years, visits were held every 6 months. At these visits, the data collected included information on adherence to study treatments, tolerability of study treatments, blood pressure, cognitive function, disability, and the occurrence of major clinical events. Blood pressure was measured in duplicate, to the nearest 2 mm Hg, with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. Wherever possible, clinic visits were continued for the entire scheduled duration of follow-up for all surviving randomised participants, including those who discontinued study drug treatment for any reason.\n\nThe primary study outcome was fatal or non-fatal stroke, defined as an acute disturbance of focal neurological function with symp\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"perindopril with indapamide\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "multiline": true, "verbose": false, "default": "", "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def answer(\n        self,\n        *,\n        context: str,\n        question: str,\n        multiline: bool = False,\n        verbose: bool = False,\n        default: str = \"\",\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate an answer to a question given some context.\"\"\"\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(question)\n        stop = None if multiline else \"\\n\"\n        response = await self._complete(\n            context + question, stop=stop, max_tokens=max_tokens\n        )\n        answer = self._extract_answer(response)\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(answer)\n        return answer\n"}, "01GCB3B0MP594PH0VC2T9K9VS5.children.01GCB3B0NPRVVRQ6SPJ5401AWN": true}

To do so, we experimentally vary whether certificates on workers' non-cognitive skills are disclosed to both sides of the market during 1,200 real job interviews between young labor market entrants and small firms in Uganda. We elicit the beliefs of managers on the skills of workers after each job interview, and track the workers' labor market expectations and realized labor market outcomes for two years.\n\nOur results show that the certificates impact beliefs on both sides of the market: the certificates cause workers to increase their expectations, such as expected earnings, while managers of higher ability, who value non-cognitive skills more, revise their assessments of the workers' skills upwards. The updating of workers is driven by a reduction in their perceived difficulty of signaling skills in the market, rather than by workers learning about their own skills. The two-sided reaction to the certificates in terms of beliefs leads to a more efficient allocation of workers to jobs, which then causes earnings to increase, as employed workers with a certificate earn 11% more in the two years after the intervention. * We are grateful to Imran Rasul, Richard Blundell and Costas Meghir for their invaluable advice and support, and to everyone at BRAC Uganda who made this project possible. We also thank\n\nMatching the right workers to the right jobs is important for productivity. Models of job matching emphasize that the efficiency of the matching process depends on the information available to both workers and firms (Jovanovic, 1979;Chade, 2006;Chade and Eeckhout, 2017). On the one hand, difficulties in screening workers can affect the ability of firms to select the right employees. On the other hand, difficulties in signaling skills to employers can impact the ability of workers to match with the right jobs, or even their ex ante decision to acquire human capital (Spence, 1973). Understanding information frictions on skills is thus important, as they can affect the efficient allocation of labor, and ultimately productivity and output.\n\nThe information problem could be even more relevant in developing countries, where labor markets tend to be informal, and access to credible screening and signaling technologies is hindered. A key question for policy is thus to what extent these frictions contribute to explaining low productivity and low wages in developing countries, as well as what policy-makers can do to address them. However, the empirical evidence on how information frictions on skills affect labor markets in low income countries, and in particular on their consequences for both workers and firms through mismatch, is at best limited (McKenzie, 2017). 1 In this paper, we contribute to this literature by studying whether lack of information on the skills of workers at recruitment reduces productivity by distorting the efficient allocation of workers to jobs. To do so, we design a field experiment in the Ugandan labor market that has two key components: (i) a matching component, whereby firms and job seekers are matched together for real job interviews, and (ii) a signaling component, by introducing experimental variation in whether a credible signal on skills that are difficult to observe is shown to both sides of the market during the recruitment process, through the provision of certificates.\n\nOur main contribution is to study how both firms and workers respond to the credible signal on skills, and how this two-sided reaction affects the matching process. On the firm side, we identify whether managers revise their beliefs on the skills of workers. On the worker side, we study whether the certificates impact the workers' perceptions about what they can achieve in the labor market, such as their expected earnings. We then develop a job search model with uncertainty on the skills of workers to link the updating of workers and firms to labor market outcomes, and compare the model predictions to reduced form impacts of the signal on the allocation of labor, overall employment and worker earnings in the two years post intervention.\n\nOur sample includes young workers fresh out of vocational training and looking for jobs, as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) looking for workers. Young workers can be particularly affected by difficulties in signaling their skills, given their lack of work experience. Similarly, SMEs do not have access to sophisticated screening technologies, and so might be less able to screen workers, compared to larger firms.\n\nWe focus the information revelation on non-cognitive or \"soft\" skills, such as trustworthiness or reliability, which are hard to observe by nature, and have been shown to have high returns in the labor market both in high and low income countries. 2  In our context, we find that managers report difficulties in observing the soft skills of job applicants to be among their most important concerns. For example, stealing by their own employees is reported as one of the most important problems SMEs face. However, there is substantial variation in the importance given to soft skills: we show that managers with higher cognitive ability, who are also more profitable, value soft skills more in production.\n\nTo identify the specific soft skills to be revealed on the certificates, we use the stated preferences of firm owners over the skills they would find most useful to observe during recruitment. 3  e focus on five skills: attendance, communication skills, creativity, trustworthiness and willingness to help others. These are measured through assessments at the vocational institutes where the workers are enrolled, before graduation. We validate our measures of soft skills by showing that they predict earnings over the two-year study period in our Control group of workers, who do not receive a certificate.\n\nWe schedule and observe over 1,200 face-to-face real job interviews between our sample of SMEs and vocational training graduates. In a randomly selected half of these interviews, the soft skills certificates are revealed to both the worker and the firm, while in the other half, neither the worker nor the firm get to observe the certificate. We collect information on: (i) stated beliefs of firm owners on the skills of each applicant, (ii) job offers and hires as a result of the job interviews, (iii) outcomes of both workers and firms in the two years post intervention, regardless of whether the job interview turned into a hire, including information on workers' labor market expectations, preferences and job search behavior.\n\nWe document that our experimental sample of workers are positively selected on soft skills, relative to the eligible population of trainees at the vocational institutes. All eligible workers were informed that the results of their skills assessments could be disclosed to firm owners during the job interviews, and so this positive selection indicates that workers with higher skills understand they have more to benefit from participating.\n\nOur first set of results relate to whether firm owners and workers respond to the certificates by updating their beliefs. We find that managers of higher ability, who value soft skills more, revise upwards their beliefs on the skills of the matched workers. The positive effect is stronger for workers with higher skills, but we find no evidence of negative updating for workers with relatively lower skills. The positive selection of workers into the experiment, along with low expectations of managers about the workers' soft skills at baseline, can explain why the certificates create mostly positive news for high ability owners. On the contrary, low ability owners, who value soft skills less, do not react at all to the information in terms of their beliefs.\n\nWe show that workers also react to the certificates by revising upwards their labor market expectations: in the two years post intervention workers with a certificate report 7% higher expected earnings, 5% higher expected employment probability, a higher intention to bargain for wages and a larger ideal firm size. The certificates also lead workers to pull away from poorly paid casual work. We interpret these findings as evidence that the certificates raise the perceived outside option of workers, who try to transition to better jobs. We further show that the updating of workers is driven by a reduction in their perceived difficulty to signal skills in the market, rather than by workers learning about their skills or about the returns to skills.\n\nThe results on firm and worker updating are then linked together through a partial equilibrium search model with heterogeneous workers and firms. In the model, soft skills have higher returns when matched to higher ability managers, and so the efficient allocation exhibits positive sorting on soft skills/ability. However, difficulties in signaling and screening increase search frictions, which results in mismatch and loss of output. We model the intervention as an increase in the precision of the signal on skills, and we show how the provision of certificates affects (and improves) the allocation of labor. Workers with higher skills earn higher wages as certificates increase their outside option, by making them able to precisely signal their type to the firms where they are most productive. On the contrary, the model makes clear that workers with lower skills can be negatively affected by the certificates, as these reduce their employment probability at higher ability firms.\n\nThe reduced form evidence on employment and earnings confirms the model predictions. We find that the certificates cause an increase in sorting, by leading to an increase in the probability of employment between our experimental sample of workers, who are positively selected on soft skills, and higher ability managers. So it is precisely those managers who value soft skills more, and who react to the certificates by revising their beliefs, who also react in terms of their hiring choices. On the contrary, there is no change in probability of employment between our experimental workers and lower ability managers. While the certificates lead to a change in the allocation of labor, they do not result in an overall increase in probability of employment, neither at the initially matched firms, nor in other firms that workers match to later on. However, in line with the allocation of labor being more efficient, experimental workers with a certificate earn 11% more while employed in the two years post intervention.\n\nThe estimated earnings benefits from the certificates outweigh the program costs. In line with the average experimental worker benefitting from the certificates, we show that workers in the Control group would be willing to pay over 40% of their monthly earnings to obtain one. Interestingly, their willingness to pay is very close to the cost of the certificates, and so we discuss potential reasons why similar certificates are not already provided by the market. Finally, we discuss the implications of introducing a mandatory certification policy on soft skills. This is an interesting exercise because we showed that those workers who decided not to participate in the intervention are negatively selected on soft skills, and so, as highlighted by the model, could be negatively affected by the certificates. In particular, we show how the cost-effectiveness of the intervention for the average eligible worker deteriorates as a function of the (negative) conjectured impact on earnings for those workers who selected out. We find that if the negative impact on the non-participants is larger than a 20% decrease in earnings, the intervention is no longer cost-effective for the average worker. This highlights how mandatory certification policies, while raising efficiency through the improved allocation of labor, could also have important redistributive effects among workers.\n\nOur study extends a very recent but growing literature on how labor market frictions in developing countries affect workers and firms (Abel et al., 2016; Abebe et al., 2017a,b; Groh et al.,\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"Non-cognitive skills certificate disclosure to job candidates and firms\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "stop": null, "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def _complete(self, prompt, **kwargs) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Send a completion request to the OpenAI API with the given prompt and parameters.\"\"\"\n        kwargs.update(\n            {\n                \"model\": self.model,\n                \"temperature\": self.temperature,\n                \"top_p\": self.top_p,\n                \"n\": 1,\n            }\n        )\n        response = await self.client.complete(prompt, **kwargs)\n        if \"choices\" not in response:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No choices in response: {response}\")\n        return response\n"}, "01GCB3B0MQDFSG9C7GJT9VTW0W.children.01GCB3B0NXVQ8RGX5TWJYW77SX": true}

Short-term reversible adverse effects associated with use in adults and children are well documented and include anemia, neutropenia, and elevation of liver enzyme levels. 3,4 In preclinical lifetime animal carcinogenicity studies, high dosages of zidovudine administered to adult rodents have been associated with the development of vaginal epithelial neoplasms in female rodents receiving the highest dosage, a finding that may be explained by the presence of high concentrations of unmetabolized zidovudine in the rodent urine and reflux from the bladder into the vagina. 5 lthough no significant short-term toxic effects were observed in PACTG 076 for those mothers and infants who received zidovudine, the late effects of in utero zidovudine exposure for growing children and adults are unknown. Based on theoretical concerns about the unknown long-term consequences in utero, PACTG 076 infant participants were prospectively monitored for late effects of therapy in an ongoing longterm follow-up study, the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 219 (PACTG 219).\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to describe the safety of perinatal zidovudine for prevention of mother-tochild HIV transmission among HIVuninfected children with in utero zidovudine exposure. Prospective comparative evaluations were made of the growth, immunologic, cognitive/developmental, cardiac, ophthalmologic, neoplasm, and mortality data available to date for the uninfected children from PACTG 076 coenrolled in PACTG 219 who were randomized to zidovudine or placebo prenatally, intrapartum, and during the immediate postnatal period.\n\nThe Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zidovudine for prevention of peri-natal HIV-1 transmission conducted in the United States and France. Asymptomatic pregnant women who were infected with HIV and their newborns were randomized to receive either zidovudine or placebo. Women were treated with oral zidovudine prepartum and intravenous zidovudine during the intrapartum period. Infants received the same randomized treatment assignment as their mothers for the first 6 weeks of life. The first subject enrolled in April 1991. The study was closed to new enrollment and unblinded in February 1994, after an interim analysis demonstrated a significant effect of zidovudine in reducing the risk of perinatal HIV transmission. 1 ll caregivers of infants enrolled in PACTG 076 centers in the United States were offered long-term follow-up for their children in PACTG 219, a long-term, prospective, observational study designed to assess late effects of in utero and neonatal exposure to antiretroviral drugs in perinatal HIV clinical trials as well as late effects of antiretroviral treatment in infected children. All children participating in PACTG perinatal prevention or treatment trials are eligible for enrollment. Comprehensive history taking and physical examinations, including growth, cognitive/developmental function, and quality-of-life data, are performed at least annually. Children are scheduled to be followed up until age 21 years. Since 1993, more than 2200 children initially enrolled in PACTG trials have been followed up in PACTG 219, and one quarter of these children had participated in perinatal prevention trials. The study was approved by the review boards for human subject research at each participating institution. Written informed consent was obtained from each child's parent or legal guardian.\n\nThe study population chosen for these analyses included children who participated in PACTG 076 and subsequently enrolled in PACTG 219. Data available as of February 28, 1997, from PACTG 076 children who were born on or before January 4, 1994, were included in this analysis. Children born after January 4, 1994, were excluded because they could not have completed 6 weeks of blinded treatment before the PACTG 076 study was unblinded. All analyses are based on the randomized assignment in PACTG 076 and are intent-to-treat analyses. Findings from uninfected children randomized to zidovudine in utero and for 6 weeks postpartum were compared with uninfected children randomized to placebo.\n\nHistory, physical examination, growth measurements, and quality-of-life assessments were collected at baseline and every 6 months for children younger than 2 years and every 12 months after age 2 years. Lymphocyte subsets were collected on the same schedule until age 2 years but only as clinically indicated thereafter. Percentages of lymphocyte subsets vary less with age and were used for these analyses. 6,7 Growth and lymphocyte subset data from PACTG 219 were combined with data collected during the initial 18-month follow-up period of the PACTG 076 protocol.\n\nCognitive/developmental function tests consisted of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development 8 for children 30 months of age or younger and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Ability 9 for children aged 30 months to 6 years. Tests were performed at baseline and every 6 months through 24 months of age and then at age 3 years. Raw data from the tests were individually reviewed by the protocol psychologist (K.O.) to ensure that tests seen as invalid by the site examiner and the protocol psychologist were not included in the analyses and questionable data (eg, widely variable scores from one test to the next) could be verified by a query to the site.\n\nEchocardiograms and ophthalmologic examinations (including visual acuity assessment and funduscopic examination) were required for all children by 36 months of age. Sites were asked to enter all echocardiographic and funduscopic results into the database regardless of whether the examination was performed as part of PACTG 219. Examining cardiologists and ophthalmologists were asked to report the clinical rel-evance of any abnormal echocardiogram or funduscopic findings, other related clinical findings (if any), and the child's current diagnosis, management plan, and health status.\n\nAll data, including deaths, echocardiogram results, funduscopic examination results, and cognitive/developmental function test results, were reviewed by members of the study team who were blinded to PACTG 076 treatment assignment.\n\nComparisons were based on PACTG 076 randomized treatment assignments and performed using t tests or Wilcoxon tests for continuous outcomes, the likelihood ratio x 2 test or Fisher exact test for categorical outcomes, and the Wei-Johnson method on repeated measures over time. 10 All P values are 2-sided.\n\nInfant length/height, weight, and head circumference measurements were converted to age-and sex-adjusted z scores using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/World Health Organization international growth standard based on the National Center for Health Statistics and Fels reference databases. 11,12 roup mean scores were calculated for specified nominal ages and expressed as the corresponding percentile.\n\nThe statistical power of this follow-up study for each outcome measure is indicated below the width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference from the placebo group mean, based on the sample sizes available. These CIs were calculated assuming a constant difference over time, based on the Wei-Johnson test. 10 Confidence intervals were also translated into more meaningful metrics, eg, the CI for the difference in z scores of weight for age was translated into a difference in SD units (SDU, expressed as a proportion of the SD of the outcome variable) as well as a difference in weight in kilograms.\n\nThe 95% CI for a difference between treatment groups over 36 months in weight-for-age z scores was \u00b10.25 z scores or \u00b10.18 SDU (corresponding to a difference of \u00b10.50 kg from the placebo group mean). The 95% CI for a dif-ference in height-for-age z scores over 36 months was \u00b10.24 z scores or \u00b10.22 SDU (corresponding to a difference of \u00b11.0 cm from the placebo group mean). The 95% CI for a difference in head circumferencefor-age z scores over 24 months was \u00b10.25 z scores, or \u00b10.21 SDU. Similarly, the 95% CI for a difference in CD4 + T lymphocyte percentage over 24 months was \u00b11.8% (0.25 SDU), and for CD8 + T lymphocyte percentage was \u00b11.5% (0.27 SDU). The 95% CI for a difference in Bayley scores over 24 months was \u00b15.0 points (0.28 SDU). With only 1 follow-up at 36 months, the 95% CI for a difference in McCarthy scores was \u00b18.9 points (0.54 SDU).\n\nThree hundred thirty-two PACTG 076 uninfected infants (177 in the zidovudine group and 155 in the placebo group) were born at US centers on or before January 4, 1994, and were alive at the time PACTG 219 opened to enrollment in May 1993. Two hundred thirty-four (122 in the zidovudine group and 112 in the placebo group) enrolled in PACTG 219 and met the defined criteria for inclusion in these analyses. One PACTG 076 infant who enrolled at 12 months of age into PACTG 219 was lost to follow-up before infection status was determined. This infant has been excluded from the analyses.\n\nTwo hundred thirty-four uninfected children randomized to zidovudine or placebo were born to 230 mothers (1.7% twin births). Characteristics of these mothers and uninfected children were similar to those of the original PACTG 076 study population and did not differ significantly when compared with the mothers and uninfected children who did not enroll in PACTG 219 (TABLE 1 ). As of February 28, 1997, the median age of the children at the time of the last follow-up visit was 4.2 years (range, 3.2-5.6 years) and 86% of the uninfected children enrolled in PACTG 219 were still participating in the study; 26 children were lost to follow-up or their caregivers refused further contact.\n\nDeaths and Malignancies. There were no deaths or malignancies among the uninfected children.\n\nGrowth. Mean age percentiles for weight and height are shown in FIGURE 1 . The uninfected zidovudine group and placebo group followed similar curves, with normal mean weight and height. There were no observed differences between the groups through 208 weeks.\n\nLikewise, no treatment differences in head circumference were noted (Figure 1 ).\n\nCognitive/Developmental Function. Five hundred ten Bayley and Mc-Carthy assessments were available from 209 uninfected children (108 in the zidovudine group and 101 in the placebo group). A total of 466 evaluable tests (91%) were included in the analysis.\n\nOverall, both the zidovudine and placebo uninfected children demonstrated normal cognitive/developmental function. Immunologic Function. Among the uninfected PACTG 076/219 children, mean CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocyte percentages did not differ between treatment groups over time (FIGURE 2 ). There were no statistically significant differences between zidovudine and placebo groups either at each point or when analyzed on an overall basis (Wei-Johnson P value = .53 for CD4 + ; P = .38 for CD8 + ).\n\nCardiac Observations. One hundred eighty-six uninfected children (80%) had at least 1 echocardiogram result recorded in the database; 97 (80%) were in the zidovudine group and 89 (80%) were in the placebo group. Sixtysix (28%) of 234 children were missing baseline examinations (ie, .36 months of age without baseline echocardiogram results reported).\n\nTwenty-nine uninfected\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"in utero exposure to zidovudine\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "stop": null, "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def _complete(self, prompt, **kwargs) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Send a completion request to the OpenAI API with the given prompt and parameters.\"\"\"\n        kwargs.update(\n            {\n                \"model\": self.model,\n                \"temperature\": self.temperature,\n                \"top_p\": self.top_p,\n                \"n\": 1,\n            }\n        )\n        response = await self.client.complete(prompt, **kwargs)\n        if \"choices\" not in response:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No choices in response: {response}\")\n        return response\n"}, "01GCB3B0N4DSFZXF616KMZGGPR.children.01GCB3B0XHPK2RDRYDCE5HB8H8": true}

Children 1 to 59 months of age were identified in twice-yearly censuses and were offered participation in the trial. Vital status was determined at subsequent censuses. The primary outcome was aggregate all-cause mortality; country-specific rates were assessed in prespecified subgroup analyses.\n\nA total of 1533 communities underwent randomization, 190,238 children were identified in the census at baseline, and 323,302 person-years were monitored. The mean (\u00b1SD) azithromycin and placebo coverage over the four twice-yearly distributions was 90.4\u00b110.4%. The overall annual mortality rate was 14.6 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received azithromycin (9.1 in Malawi, 22.5 in Niger, and 5.4 in Tanzania) and 16.5 deaths per 1000 person-years in communities that received placebo (9.6 in Malawi, 27.5 in Niger, and 5.5 in Tanzania). Mortality was 13.5% lower overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 19.8) in communities that received azithromycin than in communities that received placebo (P<0.001); the rate was 5.7% lower in Malawi (95% CI, \u22129.7 to 18.9), 18.1% lower in Niger (95% CI, 10.0 to 25.5), and 3.4% lower in Tanzania (95% CI, \u221221.2 to 23.0). Children in the age group of 1 to 5 months had the greatest effect from azithromycin (24.9% lower mortality than that with placebo; 95% CI, 10.6 to 37.0). Serious adverse events occurring within a week after administration of the trial drug or placebo were uncommon, and the rate did not differ significantly between the groups. Evaluation of selection for antibiotic resistance is ongoing.\n\nAmong postneonatal, preschool children in sub-Saharan Africa, childhood mortality was lower in communities randomly assigned to mass distribution of azithromycin than in those assigned to placebo, with the largest effect seen in Niger. Any implementation of a policy of mass distribution would need to strongly consider the potential effect of such a strategy on antibiotic resistance. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; MORDOR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02047981.\n\nT rachoma-control programs have distributed more than 600 million doses of oral azithromycin in an effort to eliminate the ocular strains of chlamydia that cause the disease. 1,2 ][11][12][13][14] The results of a case-control study and a clusterrandomized trial in an area of Ethiopia in which trachoma is endemic suggested that mass distribution of azithromycin might reduce childhood mortality. 15,16 Some experts believed that a mortality benefit was, indeed, possible, although it would probably be smaller in magnitude than what was found in these studies. 17 e tested the hypothesis that twice-yearly mass distributions of oral azithromycin would reduce mortality in children 1 to 59 months of age. The trial was performed in three geographically distinct areas: Malawi in southern Africa, Niger in West Africa, and Tanzania in East Africa. Azithromycin affects transmissible diseases, so the treatment of one person might have an effect on others in the same community. Thus, randomization and intervention were conducted at the community level, and inferences of efficacy were made at the community level. Since death is a relatively rare event even in these settings, a large trial population was required. Therefore, we adopted a trial strategy with a straightforward intervention and primary outcome. 18\n\nEligibility MORDOR (Macrolides Oraux pour R\u00e9duire les D\u00e9c\u00e8s avec un Oeil sur la R\u00e9sistance) was a cluster-randomized trial conducted in the Malawian district of Mangochi, in the Nigerien districts of Boboye and Loga, and in the Tanzanian districts of Kilosa and Gairo, with communities as the unit of randomization. The community that served as the randomization unit was a health surveillance assistance area in Malawi, a grappe (i.e., a cluster of households representing the smallest government health unit) in Niger, and a hamlet in Tanzania. None of the districts were eligible for mass distributions of azithromycin for trachoma on the basis of the most recent mapping, and none of the children who participated in the trial had previously received azithromycin. Enrollment was based on census information available before the trial. Communities with a population between 200 and 2000 inhabitants on the most recent census were eligible for enrollment (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Communities remained in the trial even if the population drifted out of this range. All children 1 to 59 months of age (truncated to month) who weighed at least 3800 g were eligible to receive azithromycin or placebo.\n\nLists of communities from the most recent pretrial census were submitted to the data coordinating center at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). For each country, communities were randomly assigned in equal proportions to 1 of 10 letters, with 5 letters coded for azithromycin and 5 for placebo (more information is provided in the statistical analysis plan in the protocol, available at NEJM.org). Randomization was performed with the sample function in R software, version 3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Only key trial personnel were aware of which letters corresponded to each group. Participants, observers, investigators, and datacleaning team members were unaware of the group assignments. Centralized randomization and simultaneous assignment of communities facilitated complete concealment of the assignments. The placebo contained the vehicle of the oral azithromycin suspension and was bottled and labeled identically to azithromycin. Both placebo and azithromycin were donated by Pfizer, which reviewed the protocol but had no other role in the trial.\n\nA house-to-house census was performed during five prescribed 6-month periods, with allowance for a 2-month grace period for the initial census. At the initial census, all households in the community were recorded in a custom-built mobile application (Conexus); the name of the head of household and the global positioning system coordinates were used to facilitate location of the household for the following census. All children 1 to 59 months of age in the household were identified. Pregnant women and children younger than 1 month of age were also documented in anticipation of the next census. At follow-up censuses, the vital status (alive, dead, or unknown) and residence (living in community, moved outside community, or unknown) were recorded for the children who had been present in the previous census records. Pregnant women and children younger than 1 month of age were documented, and children 1 to 59 months of age who had moved into the community after the previous census were also documented and were offered participation. Census data were collected in communities in the same general order throughout the trial. Data were uploaded to the Salesforce cloud database service (Salesforce). Data cleaning was performed with the use of the Salesforce platform; Stata software, version 13.1 (Statacorp); and R software.\n\nEach child 1 to 59 months of age at the time of the census was offered a single directly observed dose of oral azithromycin or placebo (according to the randomization of their community). Children were given a volume of suspension corresponding to at least 20 mg per kilogram of body weight, calculated with the use of a height stick (see the protocol), in accordance with the country's trachoma program guidelines, or by weight for children unable to stand. Children who were known to be allergic to macrolides were not given azithromycin or placebo. Azithromycin or placebo was administered at the time of the census or during additional visits in an attempt to achieve at least 80% coverage. Administration of trial medication or placebo was documented in the mobile application for each child, and community coverage was calculated relative to the census. The parents or guardians of the children and the local health posts were instructed to contact a village representative regarding any adverse events noted within 7 days after administration of azithromycin or placebo; the village representative reported the events to the site coordinator, who in turn reported the events to UCSF.\n\nThe prespecified primary outcome was the community-level, aggregate, three-country mortality rate determined with the use of data from twice-yearly censuses. Each intercensal period was analyzed separately, with a death counted only when a child was recorded as having been alive and living in the household at the time of one census and recorded as having died while residing in the community by the time of the next census. By design, no attempt was made to track down a child's status after the child moved out of the community. Person-time at risk was measured as the days between consecutive censuses; children who moved, died, or had an unknown follow-up status contributed to one half of the intercensal period. All children documented as being alive and residing in the household at the time of the initial census of each intercensal period were included in the analysis. No changes to trial outcomes were made after the trial had begun.\n\nMortality rates were assessed according to country site and age group. An abbreviated version of the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) verbal autopsy questionnaire for children 4 weeks to 14 years of age was used to collect data for verbal autopsies. 19 Causes of death were assigned according to an algorithm based on a published verbal autopsy hierarchy. 20\n\nApproval for the trial was obtained from the ethics committees at the College of Medicine, University of Malawi, Blantyre; the Niger Ministry of Health; the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research; the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; the UCSF Committee on Human Research; Emory University; and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Oral informed consent was obtained in Malawi and Niger, and written informed consent was obtained in Tanzania. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. No incentives were offered for participation. All children in the communities in Niger were offered treatment with azithromycin at the conclusion of the trial. By design, communities in Malawi were entered into the country's trachoma-control program, even though prior district-level data had not met the criteria for mass distribution.\n\nA data and safety monitoring committee provided oversight. The members of the steering committee (see the Supplementary Appendix), who were also investigators in the trial, designed the trial and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Full details of the trial design and analyses are provided in the protocol and the statistical analysis plan. The last author wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. All the authors contributed to subsequent revisions and agreed to submit the manuscript for publication.\n\nWe estimated that the inclusion of 620 communities per country would provide at least 80% power to detect 10% lower all-cause mortality overall with azithromycin than with placebo. Specifically, we assumed that mortality rates would be between 14 and 20 deaths per 1000 person-years in the placebo group, that the average community sizes would be 600 to 799 people (of whom 16.7 to 19.0% would be children 1 to 59 months of age), that coefficients of variation would be between 0.40 and 0.51, and that the loss to follow-up would be 10%.\n\nThe prespecified primary analysis was negative binomial regression of the number of deaths per community, with treatment group and country as predictors and total person-time at risk as an offset.\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"Oral azithromycin for childhood mortality\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "stop": null, "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def _complete(self, prompt, **kwargs) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Send a completion request to the OpenAI API with the given prompt and parameters.\"\"\"\n        kwargs.update(\n            {\n                \"model\": self.model,\n                \"temperature\": self.temperature,\n                \"top_p\": self.top_p,\n                \"n\": 1,\n            }\n        )\n        response = await self.client.complete(prompt, **kwargs)\n        if \"choices\" not in response:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No choices in response: {response}\")\n        return response\n"}, "01GCB3B0NCT9JS5VH1Z623KSDE.children.01GCB3B0YB3350Y0AARN10TVGJ": true}

We assessed the effect of weekly iron (120 mg elemental iron) and vitamin A (25 000 IU) supplementation on hemoglobin, iron status and malaria and nonmalaria morbidity in adolescent schoolgirls. Subjects/Methods: A total of 279 schoolgirls aged 12-18 years from public primary schools in Kisumu, western Kenya. Doubleblind randomized placebo-controlled trial using a factorial design. Results: Five months of iron supplementation was associated with a 0.52 g dl \u00c01 (0.21, 0.82) greater increase in hemoglobin relative to iron placebo. The effect was only observed in girls with iron deficiency on enrollment (1.34 g dl \u00c01 (0.79, 1.88)), but not in iron-replete girls (\u00c00.20 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.59, 0.18)). Similar differences in treatment effect were seen between menstruating and nonmenstruating girls. The effect of iron was independent of vitamin A. The baseline prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was low (6.7%) and no sustained increase in hemoglobin was seen with weekly vitamin A (\u00c00.07 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.38, 0.25)). Incidence of malaria parasitemia was higher in the iron than iron-placebo groups (Rate ratio 1.33 (0.94, 1.88)). Conclusions: Weekly iron supplementation results in substantial increases in hemoglobin concentration in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya, which may outweigh possible risks caused by malaria, but only in iron-deficient or menstruating girls and not in iron-replete and nonmenstruating girls.\n\nAnemia, including iron deficiency anemia, remains one of the most widespread public health problems in developing countries, with preschool children and pregnant women most severely affected (WHO, 2001) . During adolescence, requirements of iron and other micronutrients, including vitamin A, increase due to the rapid expansion of total blood volume and increase in lean body mass during the growth spurt, and following the onset of menstruation (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). In settings where additional risk factors of anemia (for example, malaria and hookworm) prevail and nutritional intake is inadequate, adolescents are at significant risk of developing anemia, with or without iron deficiency. The prevalence of anemia in adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be around 40% (DeMaeyer and Adiels-Tegman, 1985;ACC/SCN, 1997).\n\nAdverse consequences of anemia and iron deficiency range from severe morbidity to more subtle effects on physical work capacity and deficits in cognitive development and potentially school performance (Stoltzfus, 2001). Prepregnancy hemoglobin level and iron status are also important determinants of the risk of anemia-related morbidity and mortality during pregnancy (Brabin et al., 1998;Bothwell, 2000). Furthermore, iron deficiency may be associated with retarded growth, which in turn may be associated with obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion (Harrison, 1985).\n\nVitamin A requirements also rise significantly during puberty reflecting the role of this nutrient in sexual maturation (Michaelsson et al., 1976). Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), even when subclinical, may cause anemia through the modulation of iron metabolism as reviewed by Semba and Bloem (2002). Randomized trials in anemic subjects have shown that vitamin A added to iron supplementation gave better hematological response than iron alone (Hodges et al., 1978;Mejia and Chew, 1988;Suharno et al., 1993). VAD is also recognized to play a role in growth, development and the functioning of the immune system (ACC/ SCN, 1997).\n\nThere is a long-standing controversy about the safety of iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Although iron deficiency causes a number of biochemical abnormalities and impaired cell-mediated immunity with increased susceptibility to infections (Fleming, 1987), concerns have also been raised that hyperferremia resulting from iron therapy may exacerbate infections, in particular malaria (Oppenheimer, 2001). The controversy has received renewed attention following the recent findings from a study in Zanzibar that reported in an increased rate of severe diseases and death in malaria-endemic Zanzibar (Sazawal et al., 2006). Because vitamin A supplementation raises serum iron this might also increase susceptibility to infection. On the other hand vitamin A supplementation in deficient individuals may boost the immune response and has been shown to provide protection against a number of infections (Villamor and Fawzi, 2000). High-dose vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce the number and severity of clinical malaria attacks in one trial (Shankar et al., 1999) but not in another (Binka et al., 1995).\n\nSchool-based interventions in adolescent girls offer an opportunity to combat iron deficiency, anemia and stunting before pregnancy (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of weekly supplementation with iron alone, vitamin A alone or a combination of the two, on hemoglobin concentration and iron status in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya. We also determined whether the addition of vitamin A has the potential to decrease or neutralize any adverse effects of iron supplementation on morbidity both from malaria and other infections.\n\nThis study was conducted between April 1998 and November 1998 in the city of Kisumu (population B320 000), located on the shores of Lake Victoria, in Nyanza Province, western Kenya.\n\nMalaria transmission in this urban area is largely uncharacterized, but is perennial with highest transmission during peak rainfall from April -July and October -December. Exposure to infective mosquitoes is likely to vary from the city center to the peri-urban areas (Robert et al., 2003). A study of pregnant women attending the hospital antenatal clinic reported an overall parasitemia prevalence in teenage pregnancies of 25% (van Eijk et al., 2001) . Approximately 26% of 15-to 19-year-old girls are estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (Glynn et al., 2001). A study of vitamin A status conducted in a rural area 60 km north west of Kisumu found the prevalence of VAD (serum retinol p0.70 mmol l \u00c01 ) to be 55.2 and 17.5% in preschool and primary school girls, respectively, and none with signs of xerophthalmia (Friis et al., 1997). A study in pregnant women receiving folate supplementation suggested that folate deficiency is not a major cause of anemia among pregnant women in this area (Ouma et al., 2006).\n\nThis was a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 2 \u00c2 2 factorial design. After consent was obtained from the parents-teachers associations of 14 public primary schools within the Kisumu municipality, all girls 12-18 years were screened for the presence of anemia using a portable Hemocue system (HaemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). For logistical reasons, only schools with 410 girls fulfiling the entry criteria were considered. Girls with mild-to-moderate anemia were enrolled 6-8 weeks after screening, when a questionnaire and physical examination were completed and a repeat finger-prick blood sample taken. Pregnancy tests were conducted for girls with a history of delayed menstruation. Any girls with severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) o 7.0 g dl \u00c01 ), evidence of severe VAD (that is, signs of xerophthalmia), pregnancy or concomitant disease requiring hospitalization were excluded.\n\nBalanced block randomization scheme (N \u00bc 12) was used. Active and placebo supplements were manufactured by Laboratory and Allied Limited (Nairobi, Kenya). The key was revealed only after completion of the study.\n\nStudy participants were given one of the following supplementations: (1) iron and vitamin A, (2) iron and vitamin A placebo, (3) vitamin A and iron placebo or (4) iron placebo and vitamin A placebo (double placebo). Iron supplementation consisted of 120 mg elemental iron in the form of two 200 mg ferrous-sulfate tablets given once weekly. Vitamin A was given as 25 000 IU (8.3 mg) retinol in the form of a gelatin capsule once weekly, a dose considered safe in first trimester pregnancy (WHO, 1998) . Tablets and capsule were given at the same time with a glass of water.\n\nAll schools were visited weekly by a study nurse for supervised administration of study supplements. If girls were absent, supplements were left with the teachers. Supervised treatment was not possible during a 3-week leave period between two school terms and a 2-week teachers' strike. Instructions were given to the girls to take the study supplements at home.\n\nThe study was initially designed to include a 6-month intervention period, but shortened to 5 months following an early request from the teachers because the sixth month would have fallen in the school examination month. Girls were seen monthly after enrollment for a finger-prick blood sample (for hemoglobin concentration and malaria smear), questionnaire (including medical history, menstrual history, history of potential side effects and use of medication in the prior month) and basic physical examination (including clinical impression, skin rash and axillary temperature).\n\nAt weekly treatment visits, girls were seen by the study nurse. Girls with symptomatic illness were referred to a dedicated study pediatrician. Each girl was given a health passport and girls suspecting illness could report directly to this clinic at no cost. The study pediatrician filled in a dedicated study form that was used for passive surveillance.\n\nA Coulter Counter (Model M530, Coulter Electronics Limited, Luton, UK) was used to determine hemoglobin concentration. Daily control samples were run to determine the daily coefficient of variation, which never exceeded 7%. Blood cells and plasma were separated and stored at \u00c020 1C, and subsequently at \u00c080 1C until further processing.\n\nFerritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on stored samples in a multiplexed bead-based assay as previously described (Coutinho et al., 2005). Retinol-binding protein (RBP) was measured on stored samples in a competitive binding assay using RBP (RDI, Concord, MA, USA) coupled to microspheres as target and biotinylated anti-RBP (courtesy of Dr Hix, PATH, Seattle, WA, USA) as the competitive detection Ab, essentially as described (Coutinho et al., 2005). RBP is known to occur as a 1:1 molar complex with retinol and can be used as a surrogate marker of serum retinol and equimolar cutoffs for RBP with similar sensitivity and specificity to predict VAD as serum retinol (Gamble et al., 2001). All laboratory markers for iron and vitamin A status could be assessed only for the baseline and 3 months time points, because more than 80% of stored samples taken at the 5-month time point were lost in transport.\n\nThick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and examined for the presence of malaria parasites with a \u00c2 100 oil-emersion objective as previously described (Leenstra et al., 2003a).\n\nMeasurements of height and weight were performed at baseline according to standard World Health Organization procedures as described (Leenstra et al., 2005). Sexual maturation was assessed using a modified Tanner score based on the assessment of breast development only (Tanner, 1962).\n\nWe estimated that a sample size of 220 participants (55 per arm) would be sufficient to detect a 0.5 g dl \u00c01 . difference in the mean change in hemoglobin between the treatment groups by the end of the intervention period, with 90% power and 95% confidence, anticipating 20% dropout and assuming a standard deviation of the mean Hb level of 0.8 g dl \u00c01 .\n\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS (version 8.02, Statistical Application Software Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Analyses were done on an intention to treat basis. Ferritin, RBP, malaria and parasitemia were log normally distributed, and the data were Log e transformed (Ln(value \u00fe 1)).\n\nChanges in mean Hb, ferritin and RBP were assessed using a repeated measures linear regression model to adjust for within-subject correlation of the endpoint over time (F\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"iron supplementation\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "stop": null, "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def _complete(self, prompt, **kwargs) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Send a completion request to the OpenAI API with the given prompt and parameters.\"\"\"\n        kwargs.update(\n            {\n                \"model\": self.model,\n                \"temperature\": self.temperature,\n                \"top_p\": self.top_p,\n                \"n\": 1,\n            }\n        )\n        response = await self.client.complete(prompt, **kwargs)\n        if \"choices\" not in response:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No choices in response: {response}\")\n        return response\n"}, "01GCB3B0NGBPNS23RTF2DZE5WV.children.01GCB3B0Z2G66F2ZWAFC5RPVS8": true}

However, there is uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of blood-pressurelowering treatments for many such patients.

Active treatment comprised a flexible regimen based on the angiotensinconverting-enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of treating physicians. The primary outcome was total stroke (fatal or non-fatal). Analysis was by intention to treat.\n\nFindings Over 4 years of follow up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg. 307 (10%) individuals assigned active treatment suffered a stroke, compared with 420 (14%) assigned placebo (relative risk reduction 28% [95% CI , p<0\u20220001). Active treatment also reduced the risk of total major vascular events (26% [16][17][18][19][20][21][22] [23] [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]). There were similar reductions in the risk of stroke in hypertensive and non-hypertensive subgroups (all p<0\u202201). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide reduced blood pressure by 12/5 mm Hg and stroke risk by 43% . Single-drug therapy reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg and produced no discernable reduction in the risk of stroke.\n\nInterpretation This blood-pressure-lowering regimen reduced the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide produced larger blood pressure reductions and larger risk reductions than did single drug therapy with perindopril alone. Treatment with these two agents should now be considered routinely for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, irrespective of their blood pressure.\n\nStrokes kill about 5 million people each year, making cerebrovascular disease the second leading cause of death worldwide. 1 At least 15 million others have non-fatal strokes annually, and about a third are disabled as a consequence. 2,3 Among those who survive a stroke or a transient ischaemic attack, the risk of further stroke is very high: at least one in six suffer another stroke within 5 years. 3 The identification of safe and effective treatments for the prevention of recurrent stroke is therefore a priority. Antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of stroke and other major vascular events by between a sixth and a fifth among individuals with a history of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 4,5 and is now prescribed routinely to these patients. Carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of recurrent ipsilateral stroke in those with carotid stenosis, 6,7 and anticoagulant therapy reduces recurrent stroke risk in those with atrial fibrillation, 8 but each of these two treatments is suitable for only a small proportion of all patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. No treatment has been proven to reduce recurrent stroke risk among patients with a history of cerebral haemorrhage.\n\nObservational studies have shown that usual blood pressure levels are directly and continuously associated with the initial occurrence of ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage. 9 As a consequence, blood pressure is recognised as an important determinant of the risk of initial stroke in non-hypertensive individuals as well as in those with hypertension. 9,10 Fewer data are available about the associations of blood pressure with recurrent stroke. Hypertension has been associated with an increased risk of stroke recurrence in some, 11,12 but not other, 13 community studies of outcome after first stroke. In two small clinical studies, 14,15 blood pressure seemed to be directly associated with the risk of stroke recurrence among patients with a history of recent cerebral haemorrhage. In one of these studies, 14 a J-shaped relation between blood pressure and recurrent stroke was seen among patients with a recent history of ischaemic stroke. However, such non-linearity might reflect \"reverse causality\", whereby the most severe cerebrovascular disease lowers blood pressure and independently worsens prognosis. 16 A much larger study 17 of 2435 clinically stable individuals with a history of minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack detected no evidence of nonlinearity in the association of usual blood pressure with stroke recurrence: each 10 mm Hg lower level of systolic pressure was associated with a 28% (SE 8) lower risk of stroke.\n\nSystematic reviews of randomised trials of bloodpressure-lowering drugs in hypertensive patients, mostly without cerebrovascular disease, have shown that sustained blood pressure reductions of about Randomised trial of a perindopril-based blood-pressure-lowering regimen among 6105 individuals with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack PROGRESS Collaborative Group* Articles 5-6 mm Hg diastolic reduced the risk of initial stroke by about a third, 18 with no large differences apparent between the main drug classes. 19 Those studies provided little evidence about the separate effects of treatment on ischaemic stroke and cerebral haemorrhage. There are comparatively few randomised trials of blood-pressurelowering drugs among patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease: a meta-analysis 20 of the four trials with published final results (involving 2742 patients, most of whom had a history of ischaemic stroke) suggested that blood pressure reductions of about 6-8 mm Hg systolic and 3-4 mm Hg diastolic were associated with a fifth fewer recurrent strokes. However, the confidence interval for this estimate of treatment effect was wide and consistent with no worthwhile effect as well as with benefit. Analyses of subsets of patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease included in other trials of antihypertensive treatment regimens 21 or of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 22 yielded similar results. Clearer evidence of benefits of blood-pressure-lowering treatments for recurrent stroke risk was provided by a preliminary report from a trial of the diuretic indapamide among 5665 individuals with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack. 23  However, final results from that study remain unpublished.\n\nThe perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) 24 was started by an independent collaborative research group in an effort to resolve clinical uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of routine bloodpressure-lowering therapy for individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. We report here the principal results from this randomised, placebo-controlled trial.\n\nThe aim of PROGRESS was to determine the effects of a flexible blood-pressure-lowering regimen, involving an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and a diuretic (indapamide), on the risk of stroke and other major vascular events among individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The study was conducted in 172 collaborating centres from ten countries (see end of paper). The institutional ethics committee of each collaborating centre approved the trial and all participants provided written informed consent. The study methods and objectives are published in detail elsewhere 24 and are described here in brief.\n\nPatients were potentially eligible if they had a history of stroke (evidence of an acute disturbance of focal neurological function with symptoms lasting more than 24 h and thought to be due to intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemia) or transient ischaemic attack (evidence of an acute disturbance of focal neurological or monocular function with symptoms lasting less than 24 h and thought to be due to arterioembolic or thrombotic vascular disease) within the previous 5 years. Participants were required to have, in the opinion of the responsible physician, no definite indication (such as heart failure) for treatment with an ACE inhibitor and no definite contraindication (such as previous intolerance) to such treatment. There were no blood pressure entry criteria, although it was recommended that individuals with uncontrolled hypertension receive antihypertensive therapy with agents other than ACE inhibitors before entry to the trial. It was also recommended that participants should be clinically stable for at least 2 weeks after their most recent vascular event before entry to the study.\n\nPotentially eligible individuals entered a 4-week prerandomisation run-in period during which they received open-label perindopril (2 mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 4 mg daily for another 2 weeks). Participants who adhered to, and tolerated, the run-in treatment were randomly assigned, on a double-blind basis, continued active therapy or matching placebo. Active treatment comprised a flexible regimen based on perindopril (4 mg daily) with the addition of indapamide (2\u20225 mg daily, except in Japan where the dose was 2\u20220 mg daily) in patients for whom the responsible physician judged there to be no specific indication for or contraindication to treatment with a diuretic. Patients assigned placebo received placebo tablets identical in appearance to perindopril, and those for whom the attending physician judged there to be no specific indication for or contraindication to treatment with a diuretic also received placebo tablets identical in appearance to indapamide. The rationale for allowing the use of combination therapy was to maximise the size of the blood pressure reduction achieved.\n\nFlexibility with regard to the use of combination or single-drug therapy (or matching placebos) for individual patients was an important clinical consideration, given the initial uncertainty of many collaborating doctors about the safety of intensive blood-pressure lowering for patients with cerebrovascular disease, particularly those with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and average, or below average, blood pressure at entry. Similar considerations have guided the use of study treatment regimens in many other blood-pressurelowering trials, 18,19 in which the treating physicians were given some discretion as to the intensity of treatment provided to individual patients. However, in the present study, unlike most previous trials, the responsible physician was asked before randomisation about his or her intentions with respect to treatment intensity. Thus, the randomised treatment allocation in PROGRESS could be stratified by the intention to use a single study tablet (perindopril or single placebo) or combination study tablets (perindopril plus indapamide, or double placebo), as well as by study centre, age, sex, entry systolic blood pressure, and qualifying event. Study treatment allocation was provided by a central computerbased randomisation service accessed by telephone or facsimile. Participants were instructed to take study tablets daily. All other aspects of medical and surgical care were left to the discretion of the responsible physician.\n\nIn the year after randomisation, participants were seen on five occasions. In the second and subsequent years, visits were held every 6 months. At these visits, the data collected included information on adherence to study treatments, tolerability of study treatments, blood pressure, cognitive function, disability, and the occurrence of major clinical events. Blood pressure was measured in duplicate, to the nearest 2 mm Hg, with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. Wherever possible, clinic visits were continued for the entire scheduled duration of follow-up for all surviving randomised participants, including those who discontinued study drug treatment for any reason.\n\nThe primary study outcome was fatal or non-fatal stroke, defined as an acute disturbance of focal neurological function with symp\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"perindopril with indapamide\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "stop": null, "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def _complete(self, prompt, **kwargs) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Send a completion request to the OpenAI API with the given prompt and parameters.\"\"\"\n        kwargs.update(\n            {\n                \"model\": self.model,\n                \"temperature\": self.temperature,\n                \"top_p\": self.top_p,\n                \"n\": 1,\n            }\n        )\n        response = await self.client.complete(prompt, **kwargs)\n        if \"choices\" not in response:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No choices in response: {response}\")\n        return response\n"}, "01GCB3B0NPRVVRQ6SPJ5401AWN.children.01GCB3B0ZTYXWTTVG7YT7BZ16R": true}

Methods: Placebo controlled, double blind, random order human challenge study examining the effects of carbon particles (50 mg/m 3 ) and SO 2 (200 parts per billion (ppb)) on heart rate variability (HRV) and circulating markers of inflammation and coagulation in healthy volunteers and patients with stable angina. Results: In healthy volunteers, markers of cardiac vagal control did not fall in response to particle exposure but, compared with the response to air, increased transiently immediately after exposure (root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD) 15 (5) ms with carbon particles and 4 (3) ms) with air, p , 0.05). SO 2 exposure resulted in no immediate change but a significant reduction in HRV markers of cardiac vagal control at four hours (RMSSD 22 (3.6) ms with air, 27 (2.7) ms with SO 2 , p , 0.05). No such changes were seen in patients with stable angina. Neither pollutant caused any change in markers of inflammation or coagulation at zero, four, or 24 hours. Conclusion: In healthy volunteers, short term exposure to pure carbon particles does not cause adverse effects on HRV or a systemic inflammatory response. The adverse effects of vehicle derived particulates are likely to be caused by more reactive species found on the particle surface. SO 2 exposure does, however, reduce cardiac vagal control, a response that would be expected to increase susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia.\n\nespite improved urban air quality, exposure to ambient pollution continues to be consistently associated with daily cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 2][3][4] This association is supported by findings from panel studies showing that the risk of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmia increases within hours to days of pollutant exposure. 5 6  In addition, interventions resulting in reductions in ambient pollutants have been associated with prompt declines in rates of cardiovascular death. 7 8  hereas it is easy to understand the effects of air pollutants on patients with lung disease, the pathophysiology underlying the relation between air pollution and adverse cardiovascular events is not immediately apparent and, to show causation, plausible biological mechanisms are required. Two hypotheses have been put forward. Firstly, inhalation of fine particles and pollutant gases may provoke an inflammatory response in the lungs with the consequent release into the circulation of prothrombotic and inflammatory cytokines causing endothelial injury and increasing the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and thrombosis. 9 econdly, exposure to pollutants may stimulate airway receptors resulting in an adverse effect on cardiac autonomic control and an increased risk of arrhythmia. 10 2][13][14] The precise nature of the component pollutants that may be responsible for these effects remains unknown.\n\nIn this human challenge study we have measured the inflammatory and autonomic responses of healthy humans and patients with coronary artery disease to controlled concentrations of two specific components of vehicle derived air pollution, carbon particles and sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ).\n\nIn a random order, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study design, patients with stable angina and healthy volunteers were exposed to controlled concentrations of carbon particles and SO 2 , alone and in combination, and to medical air as a control.\n\nPure carbon particles were produced by a spark discharge aerosol generator (GFG-1000; Palas GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The aerosol and air or SO 2 were diluted and delivered to a head dome exposure system by a carrier air stream at 120 l/min. Gas flows were controlled by digital mass flow controllers. 15 The head dome has been described in detail elsewhere but in brief consists of a transparent acrylic cylinder with a lid, which is lowered over the head of the seated subject. 16 The system is sealed by means of a rubber neck seal and gases are vented to the outside.\n\nAbbreviations: APHEA-2, air pollution and health: a European approach; CRP, C reactive protein; HF, high frequency; HRV, heart rate variability; LF, low frequency; PNN50, percentage of successive RR interval differences exceeding 50 ms; RMSSD, root mean square of successive RR interval differences; SDNN, standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals\n\nThe doses of pollutants used in this study were selected as being broadly equivalent to the concentrations measured in urban air on days of high pollution. The carbon particle generator has been extensively characterised and was adjusted to produce a mass concentration of 50 mg/m 3 . 17 he particles produced are predominantly between , 10 and 300 nm in diameter, with a mode at 20-30 nm diameter, comparable with the mode in the particle size distribution in roadside air. 18 The highest roadside concentration of elemental carbon measured in a study in London and Birmingham in 2000-2002 was 31.4 mg/m 3 , averaged over 24 hours, 19 and hence hourly average concentrations of the order of 50 mg/m 3 are likely.\n\nBottled SO 2 was mixed with medical air and regulated at a dose of 200 ppb, a concentration found during air pollution episodes in urban areas. The same doses were used for the combined exposure to SO 2 and carbon. The control exposure was bottled medical air at a flow rate of 120 l/min.\n\nTwenty patients with stable angina, multivessel coronary artery disease, and good left ventricular function (ejection fraction . 40%) were recruited from the waiting list for coronary artery bypass grafting. Medication was unchanged through the study period. Twenty healthy volunteers of a similar age were recruited from a local family practice. All subjects were screened to exclude diabetes, asthma, and chronic lung disease (table 1 ).\n\nThe study was approved by South and East Birmingham regional ethics committees and subjects provided written informed consent. Subjects attended a preliminary visit to the air pollution laboratory to acclimatise themselves to the exposure system and to be trained to breathe in time to an audio signal set close to each person's resting respiratory frequency.\n\nStudies started between 8-9 am after a light breakfast. Subjects were asked to avoid alcohol and caffeine for 12 hours before each study. Subjects rested semisupine in a temperature controlled laboratory (23 \u00a11 \u02daC) and a venous cannula was inserted into a forearm vein for blood sampling. A standard three lead ECG signal was amplified, processed (high frequency (HF) signal noise filter . 500 Hz), and digitised at 500 Hz with the use of a National Instruments NB/MI0/16XH/18 analogue to digital converter board (National Instruments Corporation). A continuous arterial pressure signal was obtained with the Portapres device (TNO Biomedical Instrumentation) and was similarly digitised.\n\nRespiratory excursion was recorded from the output of a strain gauge attached to an elastic strap around the subject's chest. All signals were displayed on a personal computer running LabView 5.0 software (National Instruments Corporation).\n\nAfter the patient had rested for 30 minutes, the baseline blood sample was drawn and after a further 15 minutes, two five minute segments of ECG, respiration, and arterial blood pressure data were recorded during controlled respiration. Subjects were then exposed to the pollutant for one hour.\n\nFurther blood samples and two further five minute recordings of the heart rate variability (HRV) data were obtained immediately after exposure and again at four hours. A further blood sample was taken at 24 hours. Studies of the remaining pollutants were repeated in random order seven to 14 days apart with identical protocols.\n\nAll ECG series were edited to exclude ectopic and artefactual signals. The RR intervals before and after any extrasystoles were replaced by interpolation from the preceding and following sinus intervals. No signal containing . 1% of extrasystoles was used for analysis. R waves were detected by an individually adjusted threshold. From each five minute recording, 256 RR intervals were used for HRV analysis. Where both five minute recordings were suitable for analysis the result given is the mean value.\n\nThe conventional measures of standard deviation of normal to normal RR intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD), and percentage of successive RR interval differences exceeding 50 ms (PNN50) were calculated. The RMSSD and PNN50 indices are measures of variability of successive differences in RR intervals and assess HF (beat to beat) variation mediated by the vagus nerve. 20\n\nAs described in our previous publications, power spectra were analysed by autoregressive modelling, with a model order between 8-20 selected to minimise the Akaike information criterion. 21 Powers at low frequency (LF) (centred at 0.1 Hz) and at HF (respiratory frequency, approximately 0.25 Hz) were determined.\n\nBaroreflex sensitivity was determined by measurement of the a index-the transfer function of variability in the systolic pressure signal to the variability in the RR interval. Data segments were accepted if a coherence of . 0.5 was achieved between RR interval and systolic pressure traces. a-HF represents gain in the vagal limb of the baroreflex. 20 gh resolution C reactive protein Serum samples were analysed by a latex particle immunoturbidimetric assay on a Roche Modular P800 analyser.\n\nComplete blood count, differential white cell count, and platelet aggregation were measured with an automated analyser (Bayer Advia 120). Samples for fibrinogen and D dimers were processed by an MDA coagulation analyser. Fibrinogen was measured by a modified Clauss method (MDA Fibriquik reagent) and D dimers, with a homogeneous latex particle based immunoassay (BioMerieux MDA D dimer kit). Illinois, USA). Within subject factors were the time points at baseline, after exposure, and four hours after exposure. Between subjects factors were the exposure and the subject. In this way the effects of pure air and carbon, pure air and carbon plus SO 2 , and pure air and SO 2 were compared.\n\nValues for SDNN, RMSSD, PNN50, HF power, and LF power were not normally distributed and were therefore logged (base 10) before analysis. In all cases the graphs display change from baseline as the mean and 95% confidence interval.\n\nA further general linear model repeated measures analysis was used to investigate the interactions between air, carbon, and SO 2 . This second analysis used exposure to carbon, exposure to SO 2 , subject, and group as between subject factors. Testing the interaction terms in this analysis also allowed us to look for differences in the responses between the healthy subjects and the patients.\n\nBased on previous results, the study was designed to give 80% power to detect a difference of one standard deviation in RMSSD at a significance level of 5%.\n\nBaseline HR, blood pressure, and HRV measures within each group were not significantly different on each exposure day (tables 2 and 3). Baseline RR interval and all measures of HRV were higher in the patients with coronary artery disease, probably as a result of b blockade (tables 2 and 3).\n\nIn healthy subjects, exposure to carbon particles resulted in immediate small increases in RR interval, SDNN, and RMSSD that were significantly different from changes observed after exposure to air alone (table 2, fig 1). LF power was increased compared with air and, although HF power rose similarly, this did not reach significance (fig 2 ). Blood pressure was unchanged. At four hours after exposure to carbon particles, changes in HRV measures were no longer significantly different from those after air exposures (table 2, figs 3 and 4 ).\n\nImmediately after SO 2 exposure HRV did not change significantly. By four hours, however, reductions in RR interval, SDNN, RMSSD, and PNN50 were significantly different from the changes after exposure to air alone (fig 3 ). HF power changed si\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"Sulphur dioxide exposure, carbon particle exposure\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "multiline": true, "verbose": false, "default": "", "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def answer(\n        self,\n        *,\n        context: str,\n        question: str,\n        multiline: bool = False,\n        verbose: bool = False,\n        default: str = \"\",\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate an answer to a question given some context.\"\"\"\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(question)\n        stop = None if multiline else \"\\n\"\n        response = await self._complete(\n            context + question, stop=stop, max_tokens=max_tokens\n        )\n        answer = self._extract_answer(response)\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(answer)\n        return answer\n"}, "01GCB3B6SGBA0JG2BQAXY58MJK.children.01GCB3B6SKBWY9NMBM821GP87T": true}

We assessed the effect of weekly iron (120 mg elemental iron) and vitamin A (25 000 IU) supplementation on hemoglobin, iron status and malaria and nonmalaria morbidity in adolescent schoolgirls. Subjects/Methods: A total of 279 schoolgirls aged 12-18 years from public primary schools in Kisumu, western Kenya. Doubleblind randomized placebo-controlled trial using a factorial design. Results: Five months of iron supplementation was associated with a 0.52 g dl \u00c01 (0.21, 0.82) greater increase in hemoglobin relative to iron placebo. The effect was only observed in girls with iron deficiency on enrollment (1.34 g dl \u00c01 (0.79, 1.88)), but not in iron-replete girls (\u00c00.20 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.59, 0.18)). Similar differences in treatment effect were seen between menstruating and nonmenstruating girls. The effect of iron was independent of vitamin A. The baseline prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was low (6.7%) and no sustained increase in hemoglobin was seen with weekly vitamin A (\u00c00.07 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.38, 0.25)). Incidence of malaria parasitemia was higher in the iron than iron-placebo groups (Rate ratio 1.33 (0.94, 1.88)). Conclusions: Weekly iron supplementation results in substantial increases in hemoglobin concentration in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya, which may outweigh possible risks caused by malaria, but only in iron-deficient or menstruating girls and not in iron-replete and nonmenstruating girls.\n\nAnemia, including iron deficiency anemia, remains one of the most widespread public health problems in developing countries, with preschool children and pregnant women most severely affected (WHO, 2001) . During adolescence, requirements of iron and other micronutrients, including vitamin A, increase due to the rapid expansion of total blood volume and increase in lean body mass during the growth spurt, and following the onset of menstruation (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). In settings where additional risk factors of anemia (for example, malaria and hookworm) prevail and nutritional intake is inadequate, adolescents are at significant risk of developing anemia, with or without iron deficiency. The prevalence of anemia in adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be around 40% (DeMaeyer and Adiels-Tegman, 1985;ACC/SCN, 1997).\n\nAdverse consequences of anemia and iron deficiency range from severe morbidity to more subtle effects on physical work capacity and deficits in cognitive development and potentially school performance (Stoltzfus, 2001). Prepregnancy hemoglobin level and iron status are also important determinants of the risk of anemia-related morbidity and mortality during pregnancy (Brabin et al., 1998;Bothwell, 2000). Furthermore, iron deficiency may be associated with retarded growth, which in turn may be associated with obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion (Harrison, 1985).\n\nVitamin A requirements also rise significantly during puberty reflecting the role of this nutrient in sexual maturation (Michaelsson et al., 1976). Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), even when subclinical, may cause anemia through the modulation of iron metabolism as reviewed by Semba and Bloem (2002). Randomized trials in anemic subjects have shown that vitamin A added to iron supplementation gave better hematological response than iron alone (Hodges et al., 1978;Mejia and Chew, 1988;Suharno et al., 1993). VAD is also recognized to play a role in growth, development and the functioning of the immune system (ACC/ SCN, 1997).\n\nThere is a long-standing controversy about the safety of iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Although iron deficiency causes a number of biochemical abnormalities and impaired cell-mediated immunity with increased susceptibility to infections (Fleming, 1987), concerns have also been raised that hyperferremia resulting from iron therapy may exacerbate infections, in particular malaria (Oppenheimer, 2001). The controversy has received renewed attention following the recent findings from a study in Zanzibar that reported in an increased rate of severe diseases and death in malaria-endemic Zanzibar (Sazawal et al., 2006). Because vitamin A supplementation raises serum iron this might also increase susceptibility to infection. On the other hand vitamin A supplementation in deficient individuals may boost the immune response and has been shown to provide protection against a number of infections (Villamor and Fawzi, 2000). High-dose vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce the number and severity of clinical malaria attacks in one trial (Shankar et al., 1999) but not in another (Binka et al., 1995).\n\nSchool-based interventions in adolescent girls offer an opportunity to combat iron deficiency, anemia and stunting before pregnancy (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of weekly supplementation with iron alone, vitamin A alone or a combination of the two, on hemoglobin concentration and iron status in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya. We also determined whether the addition of vitamin A has the potential to decrease or neutralize any adverse effects of iron supplementation on morbidity both from malaria and other infections.\n\nThis study was conducted between April 1998 and November 1998 in the city of Kisumu (population B320 000), located on the shores of Lake Victoria, in Nyanza Province, western Kenya.\n\nMalaria transmission in this urban area is largely uncharacterized, but is perennial with highest transmission during peak rainfall from April -July and October -December. Exposure to infective mosquitoes is likely to vary from the city center to the peri-urban areas (Robert et al., 2003). A study of pregnant women attending the hospital antenatal clinic reported an overall parasitemia prevalence in teenage pregnancies of 25% (van Eijk et al., 2001) . Approximately 26% of 15-to 19-year-old girls are estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (Glynn et al., 2001). A study of vitamin A status conducted in a rural area 60 km north west of Kisumu found the prevalence of VAD (serum retinol p0.70 mmol l \u00c01 ) to be 55.2 and 17.5% in preschool and primary school girls, respectively, and none with signs of xerophthalmia (Friis et al., 1997). A study in pregnant women receiving folate supplementation suggested that folate deficiency is not a major cause of anemia among pregnant women in this area (Ouma et al., 2006).\n\nThis was a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 2 \u00c2 2 factorial design. After consent was obtained from the parents-teachers associations of 14 public primary schools within the Kisumu municipality, all girls 12-18 years were screened for the presence of anemia using a portable Hemocue system (HaemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). For logistical reasons, only schools with 410 girls fulfiling the entry criteria were considered. Girls with mild-to-moderate anemia were enrolled 6-8 weeks after screening, when a questionnaire and physical examination were completed and a repeat finger-prick blood sample taken. Pregnancy tests were conducted for girls with a history of delayed menstruation. Any girls with severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) o 7.0 g dl \u00c01 ), evidence of severe VAD (that is, signs of xerophthalmia), pregnancy or concomitant disease requiring hospitalization were excluded.\n\nBalanced block randomization scheme (N \u00bc 12) was used. Active and placebo supplements were manufactured by Laboratory and Allied Limited (Nairobi, Kenya). The key was revealed only after completion of the study.\n\nStudy participants were given one of the following supplementations: (1) iron and vitamin A, (2) iron and vitamin A placebo, (3) vitamin A and iron placebo or (4) iron placebo and vitamin A placebo (double placebo). Iron supplementation consisted of 120 mg elemental iron in the form of two 200 mg ferrous-sulfate tablets given once weekly. Vitamin A was given as 25 000 IU (8.3 mg) retinol in the form of a gelatin capsule once weekly, a dose considered safe in first trimester pregnancy (WHO, 1998) . Tablets and capsule were given at the same time with a glass of water.\n\nAll schools were visited weekly by a study nurse for supervised administration of study supplements. If girls were absent, supplements were left with the teachers. Supervised treatment was not possible during a 3-week leave period between two school terms and a 2-week teachers' strike. Instructions were given to the girls to take the study supplements at home.\n\nThe study was initially designed to include a 6-month intervention period, but shortened to 5 months following an early request from the teachers because the sixth month would have fallen in the school examination month. Girls were seen monthly after enrollment for a finger-prick blood sample (for hemoglobin concentration and malaria smear), questionnaire (including medical history, menstrual history, history of potential side effects and use of medication in the prior month) and basic physical examination (including clinical impression, skin rash and axillary temperature).\n\nAt weekly treatment visits, girls were seen by the study nurse. Girls with symptomatic illness were referred to a dedicated study pediatrician. Each girl was given a health passport and girls suspecting illness could report directly to this clinic at no cost. The study pediatrician filled in a dedicated study form that was used for passive surveillance.\n\nA Coulter Counter (Model M530, Coulter Electronics Limited, Luton, UK) was used to determine hemoglobin concentration. Daily control samples were run to determine the daily coefficient of variation, which never exceeded 7%. Blood cells and plasma were separated and stored at \u00c020 1C, and subsequently at \u00c080 1C until further processing.\n\nFerritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on stored samples in a multiplexed bead-based assay as previously described (Coutinho et al., 2005). Retinol-binding protein (RBP) was measured on stored samples in a competitive binding assay using RBP (RDI, Concord, MA, USA) coupled to microspheres as target and biotinylated anti-RBP (courtesy of Dr Hix, PATH, Seattle, WA, USA) as the competitive detection Ab, essentially as described (Coutinho et al., 2005). RBP is known to occur as a 1:1 molar complex with retinol and can be used as a surrogate marker of serum retinol and equimolar cutoffs for RBP with similar sensitivity and specificity to predict VAD as serum retinol (Gamble et al., 2001). All laboratory markers for iron and vitamin A status could be assessed only for the baseline and 3 months time points, because more than 80% of stored samples taken at the 5-month time point were lost in transport.\n\nThick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and examined for the presence of malaria parasites with a \u00c2 100 oil-emersion objective as previously described (Leenstra et al., 2003a).\n\nMeasurements of height and weight were performed at baseline according to standard World Health Organization procedures as described (Leenstra et al., 2005). Sexual maturation was assessed using a modified Tanner score based on the assessment of breast development only (Tanner, 1962).\n\nWe estimated that a sample size of 220 participants (55 per arm) would be sufficient to detect a 0.5 g dl \u00c01 . difference in the mean change in hemoglobin between the treatment groups by the end of the intervention period, with 90% power and 95% confidence, anticipating 20% dropout and assuming a standard deviation of the mean Hb level of 0.8 g dl \u00c01 .\n\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS (version 8.02, Statistical Application Software Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Analyses were done on an intention to treat basis. Ferritin, RBP, malaria and parasitemia were log normally distributed, and the data were Log e transformed (Ln(value \u00fe 1)).\n\nChanges in mean Hb, ferritin and RBP were assessed using a repeated measures linear regression model to adjust for within-subject correlation of the endpoint over time (F\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"vitamin A supplementation\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "multiline": true, "verbose": false, "default": "", "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def answer(\n        self,\n        *,\n        context: str,\n        question: str,\n        multiline: bool = False,\n        verbose: bool = False,\n        default: str = \"\",\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate an answer to a question given some context.\"\"\"\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(question)\n        stop = None if multiline else \"\\n\"\n        response = await self._complete(\n            context + question, stop=stop, max_tokens=max_tokens\n        )\n        answer = self._extract_answer(response)\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(answer)\n        return answer\n"}, "01GCB3B6WQMZSCPDDKARSB7G27.children.01GCB3B6WSRVC18VRKN47W9VYV": true}

All laboratory markers for iron and vitamin A status could be assessed only for the baseline and 3 months time points, because more than 80% of stored samples taken at the 5-month time point were lost in transport.\n\nThick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and examined for the presence of malaria parasites with a \u00c2 100 oil-emersion objective as previously described (Leenstra et al., 2003a).\n\nMeasurements of height and weight were performed at baseline according to standard World Health Organization procedures as described (Leenstra et al., 2005). Sexual maturation was assessed using a modified Tanner score based on the assessment of breast development only (Tanner, 1962).\n\nWe estimated that a sample size of 220 participants (55 per arm) would be sufficient to detect a 0.5 g dl \u00c01 . difference in the mean change in hemoglobin between the treatment groups by the end of the intervention period, with 90% power and 95% confidence, anticipating 20% dropout and assuming a standard deviation of the mean Hb level of 0.8 g dl \u00c01 .\n\nAll analyses were conducted in SAS (version 8.02, Statistical Application Software Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Analyses were done on an intention to treat basis. Ferritin, RBP, malaria and parasitemia were log normally distributed, and the data were Log e transformed (Ln(value \u00fe 1)).\n\nChanges in mean Hb, ferritin and RBP were assessed using a repeated measures linear regression model to adjust for within-subject correlation of the endpoint over time (F\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"vitamin A supplementation\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "stop": null, "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def _complete(self, prompt, **kwargs) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Send a completion request to the OpenAI API with the given prompt and parameters.\"\"\"\n        kwargs.update(\n            {\n                \"model\": self.model,\n                \"temperature\": self.temperature,\n                \"top_p\": self.top_p,\n                \"n\": 1,\n            }\n        )\n        response = await self.client.complete(prompt, **kwargs)\n        if \"choices\" not in response:\n            raise ValueError(f\"No choices in response: {response}\")\n        return response\n"}, "01GCB3B6WSRVC18VRKN47W9VYV.children.01GCB3B6WYDGMZNES5BGS6543J": true}

SMC involves monthly administration of the long-acting antimalarial drugs sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP-AQ) to all children under five years of age, regardless of whether or not they are infected, and is a policy recommended by WHO for malaria control in the Sahel and sub-Sahel regions of Africa [2]. To date, most studies of SMC have taken place in areas with a short rainy season [3][4][5][6][7], and current evidence suggests that, for SMC to be appropriate, 60% of the total annual burden of malaria should occur within 4 months of the year [8]. However, the basic approach used in SMC (monthly 'cycles' of SP-AQ during the period of highest risk) could be adapted to cover a longer period of risk in areas where malaria is transmitted for longer each year, and the burden is spread more evenly over a longer period. There are large highly populated areas of West Africa where SP and AQ are still highly effective, and which have rainy seasons ranging from 5 to 6 months in length [8,9]. If SMC were effective in such areas, this would substantially increase the overall population that could be protected by SMC and would help to reduce the large burden of malaria in children in West Africa. To date, only two other studies have considered SMC given over a longer period: a study in Hohoe, Ghana, where artesunate-amodiaquine was given monthly over 6 months [10], and a study in Senegal, where SP-AQ was administered monthly for 5 months (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01449045). These trials have not resulted in changes in practice because the former used an artemisinin-based combination for SMC, whereas the latter occurred in an area where 4 months of SMC would likely have been sufficient [11].\n\nA second form of drug-based prevention that would be easier for resource limited countries to implement would be to treat malaria patients with long-acting artemisinin combination therapies (LACTs), such as dihydroartemisininpiperaquine (DP) or artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ), which protect children against further malaria episodes for several weeks [12,13]. The period of 'post-treatment prophylaxis' after use of LACTs will be more useful in certain epidemiological situations than in others, for example in high burden areas where re-infection is likely soon after treatment, and particularly in high burden seasonal settings [14,15]. In such areas, LACTs could be used in combination with SMC, or instead of SMC where implementation is not feasible, for example where the malaria transmission season extends over a larger part of the year. Choice of first-line antimalarial combination is not usually made with consideration of malaria epidemiology, but this could be rationalised if there was better evidence to show where it would be effective.\n\nTo investigate these issues, we undertook a trial in the Ashanti region of Ghana to estimate the protection provided by SMC administered over 5 months and by a long-acting ACT used for malaria case management. A previous study in this area showed that amodiaquineartesunate administered every 2 months reduced fevers presumptively treated as malaria by community-based health workers (CHWs) by 37% (by intention to treat), and by 61.5% in children who received all three courses over the malaria transmission season [16]. However, the previous study was unable to confirm all fevers as malaria. CHWs resident in the study communities have since been trained to use rapid diagnostic tests to confirm malaria in children seeking treatment for illness following a standard algorithm and provide treatment for malaria using artemisinin-based combination therapies.\n\nThe study, registered with ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT01651416], was conducted among children aged 3-59 months living in 13 communities in the Kwaso subdistrict, Ejisu-Juaben municipality, in the Ashanti Region of Ghana (Figure 1 ). The rainy season begins in May and lasts until October. Malaria transmission lags around 1 month behind, with transmission usually beginning to peak in June-July, and lasting until November. Community sensitisation and meetings with community leaders took place in early 2012 prior to the start of study activities. A census was carried out in March 2012 to enumerate the children under 5 years of age living in the area. Children were screened in July 2012, and if eligible enrolled and followed up for 12 months. Inclusion criteria were that the child was aged 3-59 months; was a permanent resident of one of the study communities and was able to take and retain oral medication. Exclusion criteria were any acute or chronic illness that needed further medical attention and any history of serious adverse reactions to drugs used in the study. As in areas where SMC has now been implemented, if a child was aged between 3 and 59 months at the time of enrolment, they could continue to receive SMC that year even if subsequently older than 59 months.\n\nID numbers comprising a four digit code and a check digit were randomly allocated to one of three intervention groups in a 1:1:1 ratio in permuted blocks of 12 using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Treatment allocation was held in opaque sealed envelopes labelled only with the study ID number on the front. Upon enrolment to the study, the next envelope in the sequence was opened by the study team member to determine the treatment allocation of the child to be used throughout the study. This was carried out separately from the screening process; individuals screening children for eligibility were unaware of subsequent assignment. The three randomisation groups were (i) placebo SMC, plus a short-acting ACT (artemether-lumefantrine) for treatment of malaria episodes (hereafter the 'AL group'), (ii) placebo SMC plus a long-acting ACT (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) for treatment of malaria episodes (the 'DP group') and (iii) active SMC with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine, plus artemether-lumefantrine for treatment of malaria episodes (the 'SMC group').\n\nIncidence of malaria in the region between 16 and 24 months of age was estimated to be 1.4 per child-year by active case detection [17]; we assumed passive case detection via community-based health workers would detect 0.7 episodes per child-year. A study including approximately 800 children in each group, allowing for a 10% loss to follow-up, would have 90% power to detect a reduction of 20% in the malaria incidence rate between children given a long-acting ACT and a short-acting ACT. We assumed that SMC would reduce malaria incidence by 60% during the peak in transmission and by 40% over the study period. A study with 800 children in each group would have greater than 90% power to detect a difference of 25% between children given a long-acting ACT and those given SMC, and very high power to detect larger differences between the SMC group and the short-acting ACT.\n\nTo facilitate community-based treatment of malaria with the assigned regimen (artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine), and to ensure that children received the correct regimen if they attended at health centres in the study area, ID cards were colour-coded according to intervention group and labelled with the regimen to be used for case management. The study was therefore open-label with respect to the regimen used for case management but blinded with respect to whether seasonal malaria chemoprevention was active or placebo (members of the research team from KNUST/CGHR and LSHTM were aware of the allocation, but those who administered the SMC, and mothers/children were blinded).\n\nThe primary outcome was incidence of clinical malaria detected passively by community health workers, and at health centres serving the study area. If children presented with fever, history of fever or other symptoms suggestive of malaria, no other obvious causes of fever, no danger signs and tested positive for malaria by rapid diagnostic test (RDT, First Response P. falciparum HRP2/pLDH RDT (Premier Medical Corporation Ltd., Mumbai, India)), they received a full treatment course of either artemether-lumefantrine (AL, Lumether, Kinapharma, Ghana) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP, Duo-Cotexcin, Holley Pharmaceuticals, China) according to their intervention group. Children without symptoms of malaria, or those who tested negative by RDT, were referred to health centres or the hospitals serving the area. CHWs and health centres serving the study communities were supplied with RDTs and stocks of both ACTs; research staff stationed at health centres recorded illness visits made by study children to the outpatient clinics.\n\nBetween July and November 2012, study children received SMC with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine or identical placebos (Kinapharma, Ghana) on five occasions (once per month). SP/SP placebo and the first dose of AQ/AQ placebo were given under observation, and the two remaining AQ/AQ placebo tablets were administered by caregivers at home. Two age-based dosages were used: children aged 1-4 years received 500/ 25 mg S/P and 153 mg AQ; infants received half this dose (250 mg/12.5 mg S/P, 76.5 mg AQ). In the days prior to SMC delivery, community health workers and field supervisors reminded mothers/caregivers that an SMC administration was due to take place; announcements were also made by local FM radio and by town criers. SMC or placebo was delivered by trained members of the study team at a central point in each community. For the final two cycles, community health workers followed up children who did not receive the SMC from the central point to administer the medicine. Children who reported illness or fever at the time of SMC were screened with a rapid diagnostic test, and if positive treated with an ACT according to their intervention group. Caregivers were followed up by CHWs between 4 and 7 days after each SMC administration to ask about adverse events and adherence to the SMC regimen using a standard form.\n\nAt enrolment, information was collected on basic demographic characteristics, household facilities (drinking water source, toilet facilities, cooking fuel, roof construction and floor material), durable household assets and ownership, age, condition and use of insecticide-t\n\nQuestion: In this paper, what was the placebo in the \"seasonal malaria chemoprevention\" experiment?\n\nAnswer:", "multiline": true, "verbose": false, "default": "", "max_tokens": 300}, "source": "    async def answer(\n        self,\n        *,\n        context: str,\n        question: str,\n        multiline: bool = False,\n        verbose: bool = False,\n        default: str = \"\",\n        max_tokens: int | None = None,\n    ) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Generate an answer to a question given some context.\"\"\"\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(question)\n        stop = None if multiline else \"\\n\"\n        response = await self._complete(\n            context + question, stop=stop, max_tokens=max_tokens\n        )\n        answer = self._extract_answer(response)\n        if verbose:\n            self._print_markdown(answer)\n        return answer\n"}, "01GCB3B8E4V01KGNZV9Z4HGW91.children.01GCB3B8E634SDYH53PRR5S9FQ": true}

We assessed the effect of weekly iron (120 mg elemental iron) and vitamin A (25 000 IU) supplementation on hemoglobin, iron status and malaria and nonmalaria morbidity in adolescent schoolgirls. Subjects/Methods: A total of 279 schoolgirls aged 12-18 years from public primary schools in Kisumu, western Kenya. Doubleblind randomized placebo-controlled trial using a factorial design. Results: Five months of iron supplementation was associated with a 0.52 g dl \u00c01 (0.21, 0.82) greater increase in hemoglobin relative to iron placebo. The effect was only observed in girls with iron deficiency on enrollment (1.34 g dl \u00c01 (0.79, 1.88)), but not in iron-replete girls (\u00c00.20 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.59, 0.18)). Similar differences in treatment effect were seen between menstruating and nonmenstruating girls. The effect of iron was independent of vitamin A. The baseline prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was low (6.7%) and no sustained increase in hemoglobin was seen with weekly vitamin A (\u00c00.07 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.38, 0.25)). Incidence of malaria parasitemia was higher in the iron than iron-placebo groups (Rate ratio 1.33 (0.94, 1.88)). Conclusions: Weekly iron supplementation results in substantial increases in hemoglobin concentration in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya, which may outweigh possible risks caused by malaria, but only in iron-deficient or menstruating girls and not in iron-replete and nonmenstruating girls.\n\nAnemia, including iron deficiency anemia, remains one of the most widespread public health problems in developing countries, with preschool children and pregnant women most severely affected (WHO, 2001) . During adolescence, requirements of iron and other micronutrients, including vitamin A, increase due to the rapid expansion of total blood volume and increase in lean body mass during the growth spurt, and following the onset of menstruation (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). In settings where additional risk factors of anemia (for example, malaria and hookworm) prevail and nutritional intake is inadequate, adolescents are at significant risk of developing anemia, with or without iron deficiency. The prevalence of anemia in adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be around 40% (DeMaeyer and Adiels-Tegman, 1985;ACC/SCN, 1997).\n\nAdverse consequences of anemia and iron deficiency range from severe morbidity to more subtle effects on physical work capacity and deficits in cognitive development and potentially school performance (Stoltzfus, 2001). Prepregnancy hemoglobin level and iron status are also important determinants of the risk of anemia-related morbidity and mortality during pregnancy (Brabin et al., 1998;Bothwell, 2000). Furthermore, iron deficiency may be associated with retarded growth, which in turn may be associated with obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion (Harrison, 1985).\n\nVitamin A requirements also rise significantly during puberty reflecting the role of this nutrient in sexual maturation (Michaelsson et al., 1976). Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), even when subclinical, may cause anemia through the modulation of iron metabolism as reviewed by Semba and Bloem (2002). Randomized trials in anemic subjects have shown that vitamin A added to iron supplementation gave better hematological response than iron alone (Hodges et al., 1978;Mejia and Chew, 1988;Suharno et al., 1993). VAD is also recognized to play a role in growth, development and the functioning of the immune system (ACC/ SCN, 1997).\n\nThere is a long-standing controversy about the safety of iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Although iron deficiency causes a number of biochemical abnormalities and impaired cell-mediated immunity with increased susceptibility to infections (Fleming, 1987), concerns have also been raised that hyperferremia resulting from iron therapy may exacerbate infections, in particular malaria (Oppenheimer, 2001). The controversy has received renewed attention following the recent findings from a study in Zanzibar that reported in an increased rate of severe diseases and death in malaria-endemic Zanzibar (Sazawal et al., 2006). Because vitamin A supplementation raises serum iron this might also increase susceptibility to infection. On the other hand vitamin A supplementation in deficient individuals may boost the immune response and has been shown to provide protection against a number of infections (Villamor and Fawzi, 2000). High-dose vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce the number and severity of clinical malaria attacks in one trial (Shankar et al., 1999) but not in another (Binka et al., 1995).\n\nSchool-based interventions in adolescent girls offer an opportunity to combat iron deficiency, anemia and stunting before pregnancy (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of weekly supplementation with iron alone, vitamin A alone or a combination of the two, on hemoglobin concentration and iron status in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya. We also determined whether the addition of vitamin A has the potential to decrease or neutralize any adverse effects of iron supplementation on morbidity both from malaria and other infections.\n\nThis study was conducted between April 1998 and November 1998 in the city of Kisumu (population B320 000), located on the shores of Lake Victoria, in Nyanza Province, western Kenya.\n\nMalaria transmission in this urban area is largely uncharacterized, but is perennial with highest transmission during peak rainfall from April -July and October -December. Exposure to infective mosquitoes is likely to vary from the city center to the peri-urban areas (Robert et al., 2003). A study of pregnant women attending the hospital antenatal clinic reported an overall parasitemia prevalence in teenage pregnancies of 25% (van Eijk et al., 2001) . Approximately 26% of 15-to 19-year-old girls are estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (Glynn et al., 2001). A study of vitamin A status conducted in a rural area 60 km north west of Kisumu found the prevalence of VAD (serum retinol p0.70 mmol l \u00c01 ) to be 55.2 and 17.5% in preschool and primary school girls, respectively, and none with signs of xerophthalmia (Friis et al., 1997). A study in pregnant women receiving folate supplementation suggested that folate deficiency is not a major cause of anemia among pregnant women in this area (Ouma et al., 2006).\n\nThis was a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 2 \u00c2 2 factorial design. After consent was obtained from the parents-teachers associations of 14 public primary schools within the Kisumu municipality, all girls 12-18 years were screened for the presence of anemia using a portable Hemocue system (HaemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). For logistical reasons, only schools with 410 girls fulfiling the entry criteria were considered. Girls with mild-to-moderate anemia were enrolled 6-8 weeks after screening, when a questionnaire and physical examination were completed and a repeat finger-prick blood sample taken. Pregnancy tests were conducted for girls with a history of delayed menstruation. Any girls with severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) o 7.0 g dl \u00c01 ), evidence of severe VAD (that is, signs of xerophthalmia), pregnancy or concomitant disease requiring hospitalization were excluded.\n\nBalanced block randomization scheme (N \u00bc 12) was used. Active and placebo supplements were manufactured by Laboratory and Allied Limited (Nairobi, Kenya). The key was revealed only after completion of the study.\n\nStudy participants were given one of the following supplementations: (1) iron and vitamin A, (2) iron and vitamin A placebo, (3) vitamin A and iron placebo or (4) iron placebo and vitamin A placebo (double placebo). Iron supplementation consisted of 120 mg elemental iron in the form of two 200 mg ferrous-sulfate tablets given once weekly. Vitamin A was given as 25 000 IU (8.3 mg) retinol in the form of a gelatin capsule once weekly, a dose considered safe in first trimester pregnancy (WHO, 1998) . Tablets and capsule were given at the same time with a glass of water.\n\nAll schools were visited weekly by a study nurse for supervised administration of study supplements. If girls were absent, supplements were left with the teachers. Supervised treatment was not possible during a 3-week leave period between two school terms and a 2-week teachers' strike. Instructions were given to the girls to take the study supplements at home.\n\nThe study was initially designed to include a 6-month intervention period, but shortened to 5 months following an early request from the teachers because the sixth month would have fallen in the school examination month. Girls were seen monthly after enrollment for a finger-prick blood sample (for hemoglobin concentration and malaria smear), questionnaire (including medical history, menstrual history, history of potential side effects and use of medication in the prior month) and basic physical examination (including clinical impression, skin rash and axillary temperature).\n\nAt weekly treatment visits, girls were seen by the study nurse. Girls with symptomatic illness were referred to a dedicated study pediatrician. Each girl was given a health passport and girls suspecting illness could report directly to this clinic at no cost. The study pediatrician filled in a dedicated study form that was used for passive surveillance.\n\nA Coulter Counter (Model M530, Coulter Electronics Limited, Luton, UK) was used to determine hemoglobin concentration. Daily control samples were run to determine the daily coefficient of variation, which never exceeded 7%. Blood cells and plasma were separated and stored at \u00c020 1C, and subsequently at \u00c080 1C until further processing.\n\nFerritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on stored samples in a multiplexed bead-based assay as previously described (Coutinho et al., 2005). Retinol-binding protein (RBP) was measured on stored samples in a competitive binding assay using RBP (RDI, Concord, MA, USA) coupled to microspheres as target and biotinylated anti-RBP (courtesy of Dr Hix, PATH, Seattle, WA, USA) as the competitive detection Ab, essentially as described (Coutinho et al., 2005). RBP is known to occur as a 1:1 molar complex with retinol and can be used as a surrogate marker of serum retinol and equimolar cutoffs for RBP with similar sensitivity and specificity to predict VAD as serum retinol (Gamble et al., 2001). All laboratory markers for iron and vitamin A status could be assessed only for the baseline and 3 months time points, because more than 80% of stored samples taken at the 5-month time point were lost in transport.\n\nThick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and examined for the presence of malaria parasites with a \u00c2 100 oil-emersion objective as previously described (Leenstra et al., 2003a).\n\nMeasurements of height and weight were performed at baseline according to standard World Health Organization procedures as described (Leenstra et al., 2005).

We assessed the effect of weekly iron (120 mg elemental iron) and vitamin A (25 000 IU) supplementation on hemoglobin, iron status and malaria and nonmalaria morbidity in adolescent schoolgirls. Subjects/Methods: A total of 279 schoolgirls aged 12-18 years from public primary schools in Kisumu, western Kenya. Doubleblind randomized placebo-controlled trial using a factorial design. Results: Five months of iron supplementation was associated with a 0.52 g dl \u00c01 (0.21, 0.82) greater increase in hemoglobin relative to iron placebo. The effect was only observed in girls with iron deficiency on enrollment (1.34 g dl \u00c01 (0.79, 1.88)), but not in iron-replete girls (\u00c00.20 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.59, 0.18)). Similar differences in treatment effect were seen between menstruating and nonmenstruating girls. The effect of iron was independent of vitamin A. The baseline prevalence of vitamin A deficiency was low (6.7%) and no sustained increase in hemoglobin was seen with weekly vitamin A (\u00c00.07 g dl \u00c01 (\u00c00.38, 0.25)). Incidence of malaria parasitemia was higher in the iron than iron-placebo groups (Rate ratio 1.33 (0.94, 1.88)). Conclusions: Weekly iron supplementation results in substantial increases in hemoglobin concentration in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya, which may outweigh possible risks caused by malaria, but only in iron-deficient or menstruating girls and not in iron-replete and nonmenstruating girls.\n\nAnemia, including iron deficiency anemia, remains one of the most widespread public health problems in developing countries, with preschool children and pregnant women most severely affected (WHO, 2001) . During adolescence, requirements of iron and other micronutrients, including vitamin A, increase due to the rapid expansion of total blood volume and increase in lean body mass during the growth spurt, and following the onset of menstruation (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). In settings where additional risk factors of anemia (for example, malaria and hookworm) prevail and nutritional intake is inadequate, adolescents are at significant risk of developing anemia, with or without iron deficiency. The prevalence of anemia in adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be around 40% (DeMaeyer and Adiels-Tegman, 1985;ACC/SCN, 1997).\n\nAdverse consequences of anemia and iron deficiency range from severe morbidity to more subtle effects on physical work capacity and deficits in cognitive development and potentially school performance (Stoltzfus, 2001). Prepregnancy hemoglobin level and iron status are also important determinants of the risk of anemia-related morbidity and mortality during pregnancy (Brabin et al., 1998;Bothwell, 2000). Furthermore, iron deficiency may be associated with retarded growth, which in turn may be associated with obstructed labor due to cephalopelvic disproportion (Harrison, 1985).\n\nVitamin A requirements also rise significantly during puberty reflecting the role of this nutrient in sexual maturation (Michaelsson et al., 1976). Vitamin A deficiency (VAD), even when subclinical, may cause anemia through the modulation of iron metabolism as reviewed by Semba and Bloem (2002). Randomized trials in anemic subjects have shown that vitamin A added to iron supplementation gave better hematological response than iron alone (Hodges et al., 1978;Mejia and Chew, 1988;Suharno et al., 1993). VAD is also recognized to play a role in growth, development and the functioning of the immune system (ACC/ SCN, 1997).\n\nThere is a long-standing controversy about the safety of iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Although iron deficiency causes a number of biochemical abnormalities and impaired cell-mediated immunity with increased susceptibility to infections (Fleming, 1987), concerns have also been raised that hyperferremia resulting from iron therapy may exacerbate infections, in particular malaria (Oppenheimer, 2001). The controversy has received renewed attention following the recent findings from a study in Zanzibar that reported in an increased rate of severe diseases and death in malaria-endemic Zanzibar (Sazawal et al., 2006). Because vitamin A supplementation raises serum iron this might also increase susceptibility to infection. On the other hand vitamin A supplementation in deficient individuals may boost the immune response and has been shown to provide protection against a number of infections (Villamor and Fawzi, 2000). High-dose vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce the number and severity of clinical malaria attacks in one trial (Shankar et al., 1999) but not in another (Binka et al., 1995).\n\nSchool-based interventions in adolescent girls offer an opportunity to combat iron deficiency, anemia and stunting before pregnancy (Brabin and Brabin, 1992). We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of weekly supplementation with iron alone, vitamin A alone or a combination of the two, on hemoglobin concentration and iron status in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya. We also determined whether the addition of vitamin A has the potential to decrease or neutralize any adverse effects of iron supplementation on morbidity both from malaria and other infections.\n\nThis study was conducted between April 1998 and November 1998 in the city of Kisumu (population B320 000), located on the shores of Lake Victoria, in Nyanza Province, western Kenya.\n\nMalaria transmission in this urban area is largely uncharacterized, but is perennial with highest transmission during peak rainfall from April -July and October -December. Exposure to infective mosquitoes is likely to vary from the city center to the peri-urban areas (Robert et al., 2003). A study of pregnant women attending the hospital antenatal clinic reported an overall parasitemia prevalence in teenage pregnancies of 25% (van Eijk et al., 2001) . Approximately 26% of 15-to 19-year-old girls are estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (Glynn et al., 2001). A study of vitamin A status conducted in a rural area 60 km north west of Kisumu found the prevalence of VAD (serum retinol p0.70 mmol l \u00c01 ) to be 55.2 and 17.5% in preschool and primary school girls, respectively, and none with signs of xerophthalmia (Friis et al., 1997). A study in pregnant women receiving folate supplementation suggested that folate deficiency is not a major cause of anemia among pregnant women in this area (Ouma et al., 2006).\n\nThis was a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 2 \u00c2 2 factorial design. After consent was obtained from the parents-teachers associations of 14 public primary schools within the Kisumu municipality, all girls 12-18 years were screened for the presence of anemia using a portable Hemocue system (HaemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). For logistical reasons, only schools with 410 girls fulfiling the entry criteria were considered. Girls with mild-to-moderate anemia were enrolled 6-8 weeks after screening, when a questionnaire and physical examination were completed and a repeat finger-prick blood sample taken. Pregnancy tests were conducted for girls with a history of delayed menstruation. Any girls with severe anemia (hemoglobin (Hb) o 7.0 g dl \u00c01 ), evidence of severe VAD (that is, signs of xerophthalmia), pregnancy or concomitant disease requiring hospitalization were excluded.\n\nBalanced block randomization scheme (N \u00bc 12) was used. Active and placebo supplements were manufactured by Laboratory and Allied Limited (Nairobi, Kenya). The key was revealed only after completion of the study.\n\nStudy participants were given one of the following supplementations: (1) iron and vitamin A, (2) iron and vitamin A placebo, (3) vitamin A and iron placebo or (4) iron placebo and vitamin A placebo (double placebo). Iron supplementation consisted of 120 mg elemental iron in the form of two 200 mg ferrous-sulfate tablets given once weekly. Vitamin A was given as 25 000 IU (8.3 mg) retinol in the form of a gelatin capsule once weekly, a dose considered safe in first trimester pregnancy (WHO, 1998) . Tablets and capsule were given at the same time with a glass of water.\n\nAll schools were visited weekly by a study nurse for supervised administration of study supplements. If girls were absent, supplements were left with the teachers. Supervised treatment was not possible during a 3-week leave period between two school terms and a 2-week teachers' strike. Instructions were given to the girls to take the study supplements at home.\n\nThe study was initially designed to include a 6-month intervention period, but shortened to 5 months following an early request from the teachers because the sixth month would have fallen in the school examination month. Girls were seen monthly after enrollment for a finger-prick blood sample (for hemoglobin concentration and malaria smear), questionnaire (including medical history, menstrual history, history of potential side effects and use of medication in the prior month) and basic physical examination (including clinical impression, skin rash and axillary temperature).\n\nAt weekly treatment visits, girls were seen by the study nurse. Girls with symptomatic illness were referred to a dedicated study pediatrician. Each girl was given a health passport and girls suspecting illness could report directly to this clinic at no cost. The study pediatrician filled in a dedicated study form that was used for passive surveillance.\n\nA Coulter Counter (Model M530, Coulter Electronics Limited, Luton, UK) was used to determine hemoglobin concentration. Daily control samples were run to determine the daily coefficient of variation, which never exceeded 7%. Blood cells and plasma were separated and stored at \u00c020 1C, and subsequently at \u00c080 1C until further processing.\n\nFerritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on stored samples in a multiplexed bead-based assay as previously described (Coutinho et al., 2005). Retinol-binding protein (RBP) was measured on stored samples in a competitive binding assay using RBP (RDI, Concord, MA, USA) coupled to microspheres as target and biotinylated anti-RBP (courtesy of Dr Hix, PATH, Seattle, WA, USA) as the competitive detection Ab, essentially as described (Coutinho et al., 2005). RBP is known to occur as a 1:1 molar complex with retinol and can be used as a surrogate marker of serum retinol and equimolar cutoffs for RBP with similar sensitivity and specificity to predict VAD as serum retinol (Gamble et al., 2001). All laboratory markers for iron and vitamin A status could be assessed only for the baseline and 3 months time points, because more than 80% of stored samples taken at the 5-month time point were lost in transport.\n\nThick blood smears were stained with Giemsa and examined for the presence of malaria parasites with a \u00c2 100 oil-emersion objective as previously described (Leenstra et al., 2003a).\n\nMeasurements of height and weight were performed at baseline according to standard World Health Organization procedures as described (Leenstra et al., 2005).
