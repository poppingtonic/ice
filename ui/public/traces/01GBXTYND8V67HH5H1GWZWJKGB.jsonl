The interventions lasted for eight weeks and consisted of meditation, yoga, cognitive exercises, and coping skills.\n\nModel result: The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) group, a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) group, a combination of MBSR and CBT (MBSR+CBT) group, or a wait-list control group. The MBSR group received eight weekly sessions of mindfulness meditation and yoga, the CBT group received eight weekly sessions of cognitive restructuring and coping skills training, and the MBSR+CBT group received both interventions.\n\nWhat (if any) information is in the gold standard but not in the model result?
